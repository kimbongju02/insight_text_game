      "Yoichi: \"Oh, yeah. That was a big one.\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"After that, they shut a bunch of stuff down, so there just wasn't anything to do. All in all, it kind of sucked, even worse than last year.\"\n",

      "Kakeru: \"I'm not sure if they realize how long it's been since that anime aired. Though the character Kujo dressed up as was kind of a big deal.\"\n",

      "Yoichi: \"What character did she cosplay as?\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Uh, I dunno her name, but the heroine or whatever, I guess? There were other cosplayers there too, but I feel like she was the one showing the most skin.\"\n",

      "Kakeru: \"Wait, you're into that stuff? Since when?\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"Cosplaying itself is whatever, but I'm all about sexy costumes.\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Ugh.\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"Kujo-san's got a killer body, so she definitely would have made for some 'usable' pics. Shit.\"\n",

      "*He may look like a pure and charming prince on the outside...*\n",
      "*...but on the inside, he's a skeevy horndog.*\n",
      "*\"With my baby face, I can probably pull off sneaking into the ladies' bath, don'tcha think?\" Yes, he seriously said that to me once. He's actually that bad.*\n",
      "*The gulf between his appearance and reality is bound to make any poor, starry-eyed girl's head spin.*\n",
      "*Then again, if he was as innocent as he looks, I probably wouldn't be friends with him in the first place.*\n",
      "Yoichi: \"You didn't take any pictures?\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"No, but people were all over her with the cameras. Try searching the net.\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"Good call, I'm gonna get right on that! Time to dig up some dirty images of Kujo-san!\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Okay, you need to at least be a little quieter when you say stuff like that. She'll end up hearing you.\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"I'll take that risk!\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Not on my watch. Anyway, there's the bell, so scram.\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"Yes, sir. Right away, sir.\"\n",

      "*Ms. Naruse enters the classroom right as the bell goes silent, prompting my classmates to rush to their seats.*\n",
      "Satsuki: \"Everyone's here, right? Well, I don't really have any announcements to make, but...\"\n",
      "*I half-listen to her, and my eyes start to wander.*\n",
      "Miyako: \"...\"\n",

      "*...*\n",
      "*Thank goodness, she doesn't seem to have overheard our raunchy conversation.*\n",
      "*I breathe a little easier.*\n",
      "*I'm not sure if it's because I just moved up a grade, but class is a drag.*\n",
      "*I inevitably find myself mechanically writing notes, my mind drifting, as I try to stifle the occasional yawn.*\n",
      "*Fifty minutes taking notes, rinse, and repeat. Perform this cycle umpteen times, each one feeling longer than the last, as my boredom grows, and I finally reach the promised land: after school.*\n",
      "Yoichi: \"I really wish they had janitors to do the cleanup duty instead.\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"I hear you, man.\"\n",
      "*Yoichi's complaints go in one ear and out the other as I sweep the hallway.*\n",
      "*Fortunately, cleaning the hallway is easy work. I want to get this done and go home.*\n",
      "Yoichi: \"By the way, I totally found some.\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Found what?\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"Cosplay pictures of Kujo.\"\n",

      "Yoichi: \"Usually you, y'know, tinker with photos. Enlarge the eyes here, smooth the skin out there.\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Huh. I had no idea. And you can tell if something's been touched up?\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"Sure can. Their skin will look unnaturally smooth and shiny, kinda doll-like. But Kujo-san? Man oh man.\"\n",
      "*He moves a little towards the classroom door.*\n",
      "*And then he sticks out his phone so the camera lens is pointed into the classroom.*\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Quit trying to sneak a photo.\"\n",
      "Yoichi: \"I'm not. I'm comparing. Here, check it out.\"\n",
      "Kakeru: \"Hmm?\"\n",
      "*I peer at his phone.*\n",

      "Satsuki: \"You know the same thing's true of paranormal phenomena, right? It's all in your head. The only thing exorcism does is put gullible people's minds at ease.\"\n",

      "2116 \t The sudden broadcast further disturbed us all. Everyone looked around apprehensively. The voice reverberated, and it was hard to tell just where it had originated from... Maybe from above? There might be hidden speakers above us.\n",
      "2117 \t Class Rep began to scream hysterically, probably overwhelmed by the stress and tension of the situation.\n",
      "2118 \t I couldn’t look. I shouldn’t look at her shameful state. But the more I thought about it, the more my eyes were fixated on her. I couldn’t avert my gaze from that terrifying sight. It was like my feet had been bolted to the floor.\n",
      "2119 \t The lock was released, and the door opened.\n",
      "2120 \t Class Rep was left in the room, dying and alone.\n",
      "2121 \t What?! No, who?! How did they... I didn’t notice anyone?! Kanae? No, not her. Makiba? No... It wasn’t Natsuki-sensei, either. In that case—\n",
      "2122 \t My eyes darted to Class Rep. Were we really going to kiss here...? Right before Class Rep as she lied on the verge of death? With that horrid stench lingering about?\n",
      "2123 \t We entered the main room through the open door. It was quite different from the previous rooms. Spacious, with a lofty ceiling, and a number of identical doors lined against the walls. The methodically aligned doors were reminiscent of a prison or laboratory. The large monitor in the center asserted its presence. Its intimidating nature seemed to make me even more nervous. Almost made me suffocate... It didn’t help that it felt like our very fate was in someone else’s hands with the number of cameras everywhere and the huge monitor. It went far beyond simple observation.... Well, I guess I’m not really in any position to complain about others. The words that came to my mind weren’t composed.... I looked around. Everyone was huddled together in front of the door we had come through. No one dared step foot into the main room. It was to be expected, considering Class Rep’s elimination was still fresh in our minds. Even I was reluctant to move forward. Ideally, I’d like to search the room, check things out, and prepare for the game to begin, but... I really didn’t want to move until the \"voice\" gave us another order.\n",
      "2124 \t The voice’s sudden transmission echoed in the large main room. Everyone tensed up. I was no exception, naturally gripping my fists even tighter. Just like always, and without any prior indication, the voice advanced the game with its detached tone.\n",
      "2125 \t All those not chosen wore different expressions.\n",
      "2126 \t Unlocking conditions, huh? It isn’t as simple as just using the key. I also have to fulfill the unlocking conditions. In other words, I can’t just pretend that I’m \"unlocking/raping\" her. I just hope the unlocking conditions aren’t tough to follow.\n",
      "2127 \t I left the room. The remaining people in the main room looked over at me, but I ignored them. I searched for the door leading to the exit.... Where was the \"assigned position\" the voice spoke of? All the doors looked the same. I noticed a lamp above one of the doors was blinking... That one? We moved over to the door with the blinking lamp. We stood in front of it, waiting for the next change. Will the voice announce something? Or will the door just open?\n",
      "2128 \t The electronic sound of the countdown echoed in the room as all of us gathered by the front of the barrier door. Kanae and Makiba were together. Makiba snuggled against Kanae. Byakuya-san, Nemu, and Sensei all stood some distance apart from one another.\n",
      "2129 \t All right, now what?\n",
      "2130 \t Hm? Something felt off. I observed my surroundings.\n",
      "2131 \t I jumped backwards from her sudden appearance.\n",
      "2132 \t Her skirt fluttered as she turned around, offering a glimpse of her white thighs. My gaze was pinned to her with every action she took. Everything about her looked dreadfully amazing. This was undoubtedly her natural self. Or, in more cliched terms, she possessed charisma. She might’ve been out of everyone’s reach, but she was never as captivating as she was at this very moment. I guess she just made a point of not standing out in class.\n",
      "2133 \t We all lined up in front of the door with the lit lamp.\n",
      "2134 \t We returned to the main room and stood in the designated position.\n",
      "2135 \t ...? Whose voice was that?\n",
      "2136 \t The countdown approached zero. I slowly headed for the third door.\n",
      "2137 \t As the two of us entered, the door shut. This is the bonus game room. A small box was placed near the center of the room. It was a white box, likely somehow related to this bonus game. The room itself was no different from the others. No, wait... there was no door leading to a shower room. Do all the rooms we can enter from the main room look like this? No, that can’t be right. There’s the VIP room, as well. That was clearly quite different from the other rooms. That room is too extravagant in a way and kind of puts me off, but it has a real bed and food. I’d like everyone to be able to use it if possible.\n",
      "2138 \t I returned to the main room.\n",
      "2139 \t Nemu extended her hand to Makiba.\n",
      "2140 \t I recalled the name of that isolated star, shining brightly in the low, southern sky. Kanae muttered...\n",
      "2141 \t Finally the reality of the situation we were in permeated my brain. I was in a white room. We’ve been locked up in this room since yesterday.\n",
      "2142 \t Everyone voluntarily moved to the front of the door before even being told to. The digital numbers on the monitors approached zero.\n",
      "2143 \t We left the room and stood in our designated spots.\n",
      "2144 \t The same words and details. I was beginning to get used to it. I could feel a similar lack of tension from the others, as well.\n",
      "2145 \t We stood before the barrier doors.\n",
      "2146 \t \"BONUS GAME\" was displayed on all the monitors at once.\n",
      "2147 \t Played out words.\n",
      "2148 \t I left the room. Then, I stood in my designated spot. Everyone else gathered.\n",
      "2150 \t The door quickly opened.\n",
      "2151 \t Sensei quietly sighed. She must be tired as well...\n",
      "2152 \t It was strangely quiet. It was dead silent; only the painfully loud sound of the countdown ticking down was audible. But more unsettling... Was the lack of anyone’s presence...\n",
      "2153 \t A chill ran up my spine the moment I muttered that. No... It’s too early to say that they’re gone. I walked around the room, repeating that like a mantra. The monotonous ticking of the countdown continued as I made my trip around the main room.\n",
      "2154 \t I was at a loss for words at what lied before me.\n",
      "2155 \t As I crawled forward, I felt something wet against my cheek drip down to the floor. Was that out of regret, pain, or something else entirely? I couldn’t stop crying.\n",
      "2156 \t I raised a silent scream from the spectacle before me. Nemu was crucified and the target of throwing knives.\n",
      "2157 \t . She put her hands in her skirt.\n",
      "2158 \t I tried to turn the valve with reckless abandon. Just a bit more! Open already! Open!\n",
      "2159 \t After going through the door, we arrived in a scrappy looking underground tunnel. It looked like it was just dug out and not really designed to be used as a real tunnel.\n",
      "2160 \t My tone was crystal clear as I announced my choice.\n",
      "2161 \t We entered the room.\n",
      "2162 \t I’d prove to her that I wasn’t as weak as she thought I was.\n",
      "2163 \t It was all over.\n",
      "2164 \t I was at a loss for words. Why would she ask me that?!\n",
      "2165 \t Nemu barely reacted.\n",
      "2166 \t I restrained Nemu’s body on the iron plate. She looked like a frog about to be dissected. Then I lifted her skirt and shirt up, revealing her white skin and panties.\n",
      "2167 \t Heavy breathing resounded in the white room after we finished. It was my own breathing coupled with Nemu’s. Nemu was still out of it; her eyes rolling in the back of her head. I really went overboard. But the elation from doing that outweighed my regret. I gripped my hands together as my shoulders heaved up and down. The air expelled from my lungs was hot. It was like each of my cells was bursting apart. My mind felt like it was going to begin boiling. I was unbelievably hot. I wanted to do more. I wanted to torture her even more. More, more, more!\n",
      "2168 \t So Nemu and I were eligible. But now I understood what the qualifications were. Two turns worth of unlocking must be done to be eligible.\n",
      "2169 \t I was thrown to the floor. I didn’t think I let my guard down or anything, but apparently Nemu was easily able to push me down. Flustered, I lifted the upper half of my body up and...\n",
      "2170 \t I turned my back to her and began getting dressed.\n",
      "2171 \t All of us formed a circle in front of the VIP room. Nemu stood with the VIP room at her back as she casually glanced over us.\n",
      "2172 \t I had to calm those urges. I had to sleep—even if just for a little bit. If I let that irritation build overnight, I’d just end up forcing all of that onto Nemu. And that was exactly what she wanted. I heaved a long but quiet sigh, making sure not to wake the others.\n",
      "2173 \t The main room’s lights were already on. That meant it was daytime. There was no one in the main room, though. Was no one awake yet?\n",
      "2174 \t Just as I turned my back to Nemu, I saw Kanae coming out from the dormitory.\n",
      "2175 \t Nemu didn’t seem disturbed in the least by me choosing her again. In fact, she seemed happy, a faint smile forming on her face.\n",
      "2176 \t I tied her hands behind her back, unaffected by her words as I attached a mouth widener to her face.\n",
      "2177 \t The third unlocking phase was over.\n",
      "2178 \t A momentary reprieve. I wanted to rest my head and body as much as I could. But thirty minutes would pass by in a flash if I closed my eyes for a bit.... I was tired. I approached the monitors and brought up the rules.\n",
      "2179 \t I chose Nemu once again. Nemu’s eyes narrowed.... Smile all you want. I’ll make you submit to me.\n",
      "2180 \t Her anus was modest, unlike her personality. I was looking forward to what it would look like once I was done with it.\n",
      "2181 \t ... It was over.\n",
      "2182 \t She backed down and walked away from me. Out of the corner of my eye I caught sight of Makiba rushing up to Nemu. I was concerned by how quickly Makiba grew attached to Nemu, but I didn’t really have the time to be worrying about that right now.\n",
      "2183 \t Just as I expected, Nemu’s name was called from the unidentifiable speakers that were installed somwhere in the room. Nemu was the same as always. She didn’t bat an eye.\n",
      "2184 \t Her tongue evaded mine as I attempted to infiltrate her mouth with it. Instead she used her tongue to deviously change our kiss into one where our saliva mixed heavily together.\n",
      "2185 \t After a bit... Nemu got up, staggering a little.\n",
      "2186 \t I returned to the main room.\n",
      "2187 \t The door locked itself the moment we entered the VIP room, just as it had been announced. I had a good idea what the VIP room was like since we could see into it through the glass window, but there was a huge difference between seeing it and actually experiencing it. It was elegant, like the hotel room shown on a TV show I watched recently. When I saw that hotel room on the TV in my dorm’s cafeteria, I never thought I’d actually get a chance to go into one like it. Of course, I didn’t expect to ever experience that in this bizarre situation we found ourselves in. It was in a class of its own compared to the other rooms. The room was outfitted with expensive antique furniture. The style of the furniture was probably called rococo or some other dated term, but I wasn’t quite sure. The wallpaper had an intricate pattern upon it, and the floor was a shaggy carpet. There was even a chandelier.\n",
      "2188 \t I was about to push her away, but she swiftly dodged my hands.\n",
      "2189 \t I lay down, unable to sleep in the dark room. The lights went out automatically.\n",
      "2190 \t I opened my eyes, as though that gentle voice was guiding me.\n",
      "2191 \t A bitter taste spread throughout my mouth upon realizing what I had said. I shot my gaze about. I looked horrible. I was wet with fluids, and the sheets and my clothes were a mess. I caught sight of Nemu’s back as she slept. She was no different from me. A prickly smell stimulated my nostrils, causing me to grimace. I couldn’t help but dislike that smell because it was coming from both Nemu and myself. I got up, and Nemu began to move about. I didn’t care though, instead getting off the couch and heading for the door in the back.\n",
      "2192 \t Makiba raced up to us once we returned to the main room.\n",
      "2193 \t Nemu didn’t seem perturbed in the least by me choosing her a fifth time.\n",
      "2194 \t Her mouth was pried open with a mouth widener. She let off unintelligible groans. She was all ready to go, but I was the one who wasn’t just yet. I watched over her as I waited for the time to come naturally...................... All right. This would work. I approached Nemu and opened the lid. Her clothes were stripped off, and she was fastened with restraining gear.\n",
      "2195 \t So? How was it? That was perfect, right?! You ate my shit. You are a toilet. You’re not even human.\n",
      "2196 \t Sensei called out for Kanae, who had turned into something like Rika’s caretaker as she cried.\n",
      "2197 \t At first—When I learned of the game’s rules, saw what happened to Class Rep, picked Nemu and consequently raped her... On the surface, I desperately wanted to get out of here with Kanae... But I was also thinking about how as the game progressed... I’d never want to leave this facility. These feelings were very, very deep inside of me, but... They were wrong. I did want to get out of here. I did genuinely believe that. I didn’t like this place. No, it wasn’t that. I just... Didn’t want to...\n",
      "2198 \t I raced after her. I knew I could reach her in time if I ran at full speed.\n",
      "2199 \t My mind worked at an alarmingly quick rate under the pressing circumstances. Should I really do it? Was it really all right? Didn’t I decide that I’d use the others in order to protect Kanae? Wasn’t I going to finish this game, get out of here, and lead a normal life again with Kanae? Had I gone mad?!\n",
      "2200 \t The door was unlocked, and it opened up on its own.\n",
      "2201 \t We entered the room.\n",
      "2202 \t I turned around... I guess I should close my eyes, too.\n",
      "2203 \t A difficult to describe atmosphere continued to surround us even after we had finished. It was honestly a bit unexpected.\n",
      "2204 \t She narrowed her eyes, smiling, seemingly satisfied with my response.\n",
      "2205 \t We were lucky that the first time around was so easy-going. There was a possibility that it could’ve been far worse. And if I kept on choosing Kanae...\n",
      "2206 \t The voice resounded in the room. Nemu seemed pleased. Everyone else acted the same as they did last time. I couldn’t look Kanae in the eye. A sense of relief, like this was for the best, and guilt mixed together within me. I didn’t understand just what that relief meant, though. Perhaps it was born from the thought that things couldn’t get any worse than this.\n",
      "2207 \t The \"voice\" confirmed our entrance. I soon realized this was going to be the same as last time. I waited for the \"voice\" to finish its explanation. I was painfully conscious of Kanae as she stood beside me. Why did I choose her? Did I really not want to return to those normal days with her? That wasn’t true. And yet, I still chose her out of all the others.\n",
      "2208 \t That was fine. She was about to be spanked for the first time soon enough.\n",
      "2209 \t I took the items from Kanae and put them back in the box.\n",
      "2210 \t So Kanae and I were eligible. I now understood what the qualifications were. Two turns worth of unlocking must be done to be eligible.\n",
      "2211 \t It was nice that there was no time limit in place... Guess I’d open the box. I picked the tiny box up. It was quite light. The lid opened when I pressed the button, and I removed the instructions from inside. I read them.\n",
      "2212 \t There was a chair placed in the room already. And I sat down in that simple chair.\n",
      "2213 \t Kanae wiped off my semen with her handkerchief.\n",
      "2214 \t Makiba cast her head down, seemingly about to cry. She really had no authority to make things go her way in situations like this. But Sensei seemed troubled as she looked at Makiba like that.\n",
      "2215 \t ..................\n",
      "2216 \t She looked straight at me and gave a big nod. She gazed at me with those large pupils of hers, showing no sign of regret.\n",
      "2217 \t The voice went over the usual stuff. We just stood there waiting as it did so.\n",
      "2218 \t I turned around. This was the third phase, but she was still embarrassed.\n",
      "2219 \t The third unlocking phase was over.\n",
      "2220 \t ... I didn’t want to be by Kanae. She wasn’t at fault at all. I was afraid of myself. What was with that creepy image? Was it a delusion? Or was it a wish of mine? I was aware of a part of me that wanted to realize that delusion. My feelings were split... It sucked. I felt extremely violent. It was like I was poisoning myself. I needed to be alone until the next turn started.\n",
      "2221 \t Kanae smiled at me picking her. Why would she do that? Something was wrong. Something was wrong with both Kanae and me. It was so wrong that I couldn’t even say just what it was exactly that was wrong.\n",
      "2222 \t I said that to her as I faced forward.\n",
      "2223 \t I showed her the item I took out of the box. She nodded. The note stated anal birth. I had to put this object inside of her bowels so she could give birth to it. Her heated gaze was focused on the object I was holding.\n",
      "2224 \t I picked up the item beside Kanae and dropped it into the box.\n",
      "2225 \t —I don’t want her to steal you from me. Her words repeated in my head. That’s wrong... That’s wrong, Kanae. Nemu doesn’t want me in a romantic sense like you do...\n",
      "2226 \t We both expressed our intent to participate.\n",
      "2227 \t The door shut the moment we entered the room. A box was waiting for us in the middle of the room. I recalled what happened last time. The bonus game’s instructions were much different from the unlocking I had done before... Would it be the same this time around, too?\n",
      "2228 \t She nodded.\n",
      "2229 \t Kanae didn’t change in the least, despite me doing such horrible things to her. No amount of apologizing would ever make up for that, either. She held her hand out. I hesitated for a moment before grasping it. We held hands as we headed for the main room.\n",
      "2230 \t We returned to the main room. Makiba raced up to us.\n",
      "2231 \t The door locked itself the moment we entered the VIP room, just as it had been announced. I mean, I had a good idea what the VIP room was like, considering we could see into it through the glass window, but there was a huge difference between seeing it and actually experiencing it. It was elegant, like the hotel room shown on a TV show I watched recently. When I saw that hotel room on the TV in my dorm’s cafeteria, I never thought I’d actually get a chance to go into one like it. Of course, I didn’t expect to ever experience that in this bizarre situation we found ourselves in. It was in a class of its own compared to the other rooms. The room was outfitted with expensive antique furniture. The style of the furniture was probably called rococo or some other dated term, but I wasn’t quite sure. The wallpaper had an intricate pattern upon it, and the floor was a shaggy carpet. There was even a chandelier. I looked out to the main room from the giant glass window. No one was there. They must’ve all moved to that dorm I slept in last night. I was a little relieved by that. There was a thick, heavy curtain attached to the glass window.\n",
      "2232 \t She lowered her hips, and my penis was buried inside of her. She tightly shut her eyes and moaned from feeling my penis in the back of her vagina. Her tightness made me very aware that this was still only the second time we had vaginal sex, despite all the other bizarre things we did in those white rooms. She really was tight... It was almost like her vagina was rejecting me against her will, but she was still attempting to take me.\n",
      "2233 \t The lights suddenly went out. I looked at Kanae as she slept. There was no turning back now. Kanae and I were childhood friends, like family... And now I was her owner, and she, my property. Kanae would live under me... and I would never let her go. Just how did this happen? Where did things go wrong? But I would never regret that... I couldn’t regret it.\n",
      "2234 \t We walked up the snow covered hill. Having to go back with Kanae to get something she forgot during the first major snowstorm of the year was horrible luck. Actually, maybe that wasn’t the case. Neither of us had many opportunities to meet at night since the girls’ and boys’ dorms were separate. I snuck out. I’d have to give my thanks to the guys back at the door later. Kanae left behind homework that she had to finish today no matter what. I knew which teacher gave her that homework, and he wasn’t the type who would let her get away with that. That’s why the dorm mother permitted her to get it. It was a five minute walk from our dorm to the school. But the snowy path was more slippery than I expected.\n",
      "2235 \t Kanae showed no sign of hesitation as I chose her once again.\n",
      "2236 \t The door shut on its own.\n",
      "2237 \t I put my fingers on the analog dial and began to turn it.\n",
      "2238 \t I removed the restraints from Kanae and embraced her.\n",
      "2239 \t I was tired... I was definitely tired, but... Part of me felt at ease, too. I wanted to prepare myself for the new life I’d be spending with Kanae.\n",
      "2240 \t We all did our own thing during the final interval. Sensei stood before the monitors in the center of the room, keeping a close watch on the door. I had no idea where Byakuya-san was. Makiba was likely in the dormitory with Kanae. And I stood before the final door.\n",
      "2241 \t She didn’t show any particular reaction to me choosing her.\n",
      "2242 \t The door swiftly closed behind us the moment we entered the room.\n",
      "2243 \t Byakuya-san’s body fell to the floor as I thrust her away. I slid her panties to the side, revealing her genitals from between her already-torn black stockings. She had a gag in her mouth, and I tied her up with her clothes still on in such a way that the rope wouldn’t easily come undone. I was really going to rape one of my classmates... Someone the same age as me, but one I didn’t know very well.\n",
      "2244 \t ... It was all over.\n",
      "2245 \t I looked over at everyone lined up, then shifted my gaze to Byakuya-san. Our eyes met. What happened during the first turn came to mind once again. I recalled what she said when she came out from the shower room once we were done. That suggestive phrase...\n",
      "2246 \t The \"voice\" confirmed our entrance. I knew this was going to be similar to the last time. I waited for the \"voice\" to finish its explanation.\n",
      "2247 \t She pressed her smooth soles right against my scorching hot rod. Even through her stockings, I could tell that her feet were ice cold.\n",
      "2248 \t ..................\n",
      "2249 \t So Byakuya-san and I were eligible. But now I understood what the qualifications were. Two turns worth of unlocking must be done to be eligible.\n",
      "2250 \t Then fell silent.\n",
      "2251 \t She unzipped my pants and took out my half-erect dick. My disturbance was clearly reflected in my penis. Wait, hadn’t she been doing stuff for me ever since the first time around...? I’d rather do things to her, to be honest... She propped up my dick with her spindly fingers. Not only was her body slender, but her fingers were, as well... They were chilly, like a ceramic doll’s. Her long black hair teased at the tip of my dick. It felt good. It was silky smooth... Her hair really was pretty... Half of the people that meet her for the first time likely take notice of her hair first. The other half likely immediately take notice of her prim, but expressionless, doll-like face.\n",
      "2252 \t She wiped the semen out from her black hair using my handkerchief and her own. She licked up the rest she couldn’t get out.... She really was the type of person to just not care.\n",
      "2253 \t Byakuya-san spoke up first.\n",
      "2254 \t She looked back at me after I called out to her. She didn’t seem particularly fazed by that. She’d likely retain her composure even if an earthquake occurred and this facility was severely damaged.\n",
      "2255 \t I glanced at Nemu. She sent me a silent signal with her faint smile.—You know what to do, right?\n",
      "2256 \t The voice went over the usual stuff. We just stood there waiting as it did so.\n",
      "2257 \t I restrained Byakuya-san using the items that were in the box. Her expression was the same as always, even though she was restrained with wooden bindings in a rather uncomfortable position. She was completely silent, as if she were a marble sculpture. The only indication that she was an actual living being was from the rising and falling of her chest. Her peaceful expression had an almost holy atmosphere to it. I gripped the item in my hand. I was about to use it on her...... She was so collected that it was almost like she had undergone this sort of torture before. She looked at me.\n",
      "2258 \t The third unlocking phase was over.\n",
      "2259 \t A momentary reprieve. I wanted to rest my head and body as much as I could. But thirty minutes would pass by in a flash if I closed my eyes for a bit.... I was tired. I approached the monitors and brought up the rules.\n",
      "2260 \t My eyes met with Byakuya-san’s. Choosing her meant that we could search for the exit. That was just one of my goals, though. My true goal was something else entirely.\n",
      "2261 \t The \"voice\" went on like always. Neither of us spoke. I stole a quick glance of her side profile as she stood next to me. She really was pretty from the side. You could feel her tranquility. For some reason, seeing her like this brought to mind a religious painting I once saw on TV.\n",
      "2262 \t I tied her up using the rope that was in the box and pushed her to the floor.\n",
      "2263 \t Byakuya-san’s body was limp as I took the items from her and tossed them back into the box.\n",
      "2264 \t Where was Byakuya-san? The main room was quite spacious; I should’ve been able to find her rather easily... There she was.\n",
      "2265 \t We responded at roughly the same time.\n",
      "2266 \t The door shut the moment we entered the room. A box was waiting for us in the middle of the room. I recalled what happened last time. The bonus game’s instructions were much different from the unlocking I had done before... Would it be the same this time around, too? It’d be nice if I could take the lead...\n",
      "2267 \t The instructions for this bonus game detailed a full course oral service—including fellatio, smegma consumption, and cum drinking. She didn’t react in the slightest to being told to eat my smegma, though. It was kind of impressive.\n",
      "2268 \t Byakuya-san nodded and then got on her knees. I headed over to the other side of the room and did the same. We started our investigation from opposite sides of the room, gradually heading toward the middle of it. As we got closer, I heard her whisper the following...\n",
      "2269 \t We returned to the main room.\n",
      "2270 \t That put me at ease. Makiba would’ve likely been all hyper if she was in here, and Nemu would probably act like she owned the place.\n",
      "2271 \t Her walls, steeped in her fluids, gently embraced my dick as I thrust it in. She seemed to be enjoying it since I had never heard her voice like that before.\n",
      "2272 \t We rested in the bed for a bit before taking a shower and getting changed. I was considering investigating things in the morning while everyone was still asleep, but... Night brings about changes as well. Perhaps the door could be opened from the inside. I approached the door.... There was a button to apparently open and close the door beside it. I tried pressing the button.... But the door didn’t budge. I guess I’d have to wait till morn—\n",
      "2273 \t I woke up the moment the lights came on, I guess because I went to bed with the intention of getting up early. I was glad I didn’t sleep in... Would the door actually open? I looked at Byakuya-san as she slept beside me. We stopped holding hands at some point. Should I wake her?... Her complexion still didn’t look great, and she still wore a grimace on her face. I guess I shouldn’t. I’d just search by myself. I could just wake her if I found something.\n",
      "2274 \t The door opened. I looked over toward the dormitory. It didn’t seem like anyone had woken up yet... Okay. I proceeded to walk along the main room’s wall. Thankfully, my footsteps didn’t echo.\n",
      "2275 \t The door opened on its own. I grabbed Byakuya-san’s hand and swiftly headed for the individual room, still feeling like I had to rush.\n",
      "2276 \t The door shut on its own.\n",
      "2277 \t I could tell my visage contorted. Was I really hoping that she would beg for her life after all this time? Would I have not played in this game otherwise? Would I have chosen death—both my own and everyone else’s—instead? Would I have chosen doom for myself and Kanae? I can say for certain that I still would’ve played in this game, even if it meant Byakuya-san ended up pleading for her life. The ranks had been determined, and I was the worst. There was no need to hesitate or hold back. Just... begin.\n",
      "2278 \t ..................\n",
      "2279 \t Exhaustion and lethargy weighed heavily upon me. But this was our chance.\n",
      "2280 \t We all did our own thing during the final interval. Sensei stayed by the monitors in the center of the room, presumably watching over what was happening with the final door. Kanae and Makiba were likely in the dormitory.\n",
      "2281 \t The trap floor remained open, but the square shielded door beneath it was shut. Did someone shut it, or was it just designed to close automatically? No point in worrying about it. Let’s head to the cave. I gripped the valve-like handle and began to turn it.\n",
      "2282 \t They were calling for us. It was...\n",
      "2283 \t I ran up to Kanae in the main room.\n",
      "2284 \t Makiba and Rinne showed back up.\n",
      "2285 \t I looked at Rinne.\n",
      "2286 \t Makiba stared at me in amazement.\n",
      "2287 \t The door closed when we entered the room.\n",
      "2288 \t Makiba continued to appeal for help in her panicked state, even though I forcibly kept her underwater.\n",
      "2289 \t It was all over.\n",
      "2290 \t That’s right. I had voluntarily decided to partake in this game. I would accept all the hate that came with that.\n",
      "2291 \t The voice repeated my selection. Nemu looked thrilled. Everyone else reacted similarly to the way they did last time.\n",
      "2292 \t I pulled her tiny self with me as I entered the room. The door quickly closed.\n",
      "2293 \t She raised a scream of rejection and despair as I pulled her panties down. I completely bound her down with the frayed rope contained inside of the box, though she still continued to struggle, fruitlessly attempting to escape.\n",
      "2294 \t ... I stripped Makiba of the rope in her sorry state and pushed it into the box.\n",
      "2295 \t So Rika and I were eligible. I understood what the qualifications were now, though. Two turns worth of unlocking must be done to be eligible.\n",
      "2296 \t Then fell silent.\n",
      "2297 \t Rika darted her eyes about as she answered. Sounds like she had a complex about not knowing as much about sex as the rest of her class. Well, I couldn’t care less one way or the other. I’ll just teach her myself.\n",
      "2298 \t Rika ecstatically ran around the room. She was surprisingly energetic. Or, rather, tough.\n",
      "2299 \t Kanae nodded in agreement.\n",
      "2300 \t Wouldn’t I just be making others suffer in that case? Kanae must realize that...\n",
      "2301 \t ..................\n",
      "2302 \t Guess the main room’s lights were already on. Meaning it must have been daytime. Nemu and Makiba exited the VIP room upon its door opening. Nemu walked up to me. She stood before me with an air of composure.\n",
      "2303 \t I grabbed hold of her arm as she tried to escape. She froze up.\n",
      "2304 \t  enough. But no one would. Even if someone tried to persuade me to save her, I would still hold the final say in the matter.\n",
      "2305 \t I forced Makiba to wear the clothes that were provided in the box. She averted her gaze from my dick. Veins rose up along my shaft, which seemed ready to burst from how tall and hard it towered.\n",
      "2306 \t I put the key back in the box. We cleared the unlock conditions. I showered after Makiba did.\n",
      "2307 \t A momentary reprieve. I wanted to rest my head and body as much as I could. But thirty minutes will pass by in a flash if I close my eyes for a bit.... I was tired. I approached the monitors and brought up the rules.\n",
      "2308 \t Makiba didn’t react at all. She was totally exhausted.\n",
      "2309 \t The voice echoed in the room. Makiba said nothing. Her arms dangled at her sides like a doll with its strings cut away.\n",
      "2310 \t Her eyes went wide with shock, and her face quickly grew red. Her fingers reached for the collar digging into her neck.\n",
      "2311 \t I left Makiba alone as I tossed the camera and such into the box.\n",
      "2312 \t She smiled and then headed off to Makiba’s side. Kanae may know me better than anyone else, but her judgment just now was a bit too naive. My calculating mind was not deserving of such kind words.\n",
      "2313 \t The lamp above the bonus game room’s door turned green, and the door opened.\n",
      "2314 \t The door shut the moment we entered. There was a box in the middle of the room. I recalled what happened last time. I likely just had to make Makiba service me instead of doing something specific myself.\n",
      "2315 \t We passed through the main room... I did my best not to look at the others as we did so.\n",
      "2316 \t Makiba vomited. Chunky bits of excreta composed of cloudy fluids and food poured out from her mouth. I rubbed her back as she did so in pain. Her vomit had a sour scent to it.\n",
      "2317 \t ...\n",
      "2318 \t I walked over to her and grabbed her hand.\n",
      "2319 \t The door closed.\n",
      "2320 \t I pressed Makiba to the floor against her will as she struggled with all the power her tiny body could muster. Taking off her panties was too much of a hassle, so I just shoved it right in. I buried my dick up to its base in her vagina, prompting her to raise a voice of true rejection.\n",
      "2321 \t There was nothing to put in the box, though. I just shut the empty box’s lid.\n",
      "2322 \t Of course she was tired. It was like we had the goal post mere inches away from us and then it was suddenly moved miles away. A sense of despondency and exhaustion weighed upon me.\n",
      "2323 \t We all did our own thing during the final interval. Sensei stood before the monitors in the center of the room, keeping a close watch on the door. Makiba went to the dormitory with Kanae.\n",
      "2324 \t Makiba was in the dormitory. I didn’t want to bother her, so I figured I’d rest in the main room. Nemu and Sensei were speaking to each other. Byakuya-san wasn’t around. I guess she was in the dormitory.\n",
      "2325 \t I stumbled on something and fell down. Luckily, I managed to let go of Kanae’s hand before I did.\n",
      "2326 \t Sensei’s body tensed up.\n",
      "2327 \t I entered the room, and Sensei swiftly followed behind me.\n",
      "2328 \t I intentionally stopped speaking politely to her. It made me feel like I was above her.\n",
      "2329 \t ... It was all over.\n",
      "2330 \t The voice resounded in the room. Nemu seemed pleased. Everyone else acted the same as they did last time. Sensei nodded. She was more calm than last time. Her eyes were filled with resolve. I recalled what she said before.\n",
      "2331 \t My heart was pounding. I was tense. There was no reason for me to choose Sensei twice. She might suspect something was up this time. She might even find out the truth. If she were to find out that I was happily raping her... But I... I wanted to savor her body once again. I wanted to make her kind face grimace and scream once again. I wanted to taste every inch of her body as she trembled in pain. I craved her body.\n",
      "2332 \t The lights went out. I grew slightly nervous as total darkness descended over us.\n",
      "2333 \t —Kei-chan. I suddenly heard Kanae’s voice calling for me. It wasn’t real, of course. It was just me imagining things. I lightly shook my head from side to side.... Kanae was so kind. My precious Kanae. She would be sad—very sad—if she knew I was the type of person who wanted to sexually assault others.\n",
      "2334 \t My eyes met with Sensei’s own. She looked worried. She’d probably be afraid if I smiled at her. That’s why I looked down instead. So she couldn’t see my face. Then I jumped at her.\n",
      "2335 \t I used the items in the box to tie Sensei up and left her on the floor. I had to use all the packing tape in the box to restrain her. I plastered it on top of the vibrators I buried into her inverted nipples.\n",
      "2336 \t She couldn’t move. I tried my best to carefully take the items off of her and returned them to the box.\n",
      "2337 \t I saw Sensei sitting down, leaning against the wall as I left the shower room. She must’ve still been tired... I approached her. She had her eyes shut and took shallow breaths. She opened her eyes as she heard my footsteps.\n",
      "2338 \t So Sensei and I were eligible. I understood what the qualifications were now, though. Two turns worth of unlocking must be done to be eligible.\n",
      "2339 \t Then fell silent.\n",
      "2340 \t  wasn’t even the proper word to describe her especially huge breasts, which my dick was completely buried within. Her areolas were large, too... Her inverted nipples seemed to twitch in rhythm with her breathing like a woman’s genitals. My dick was between her tits. Her warm, soft breasts had completely wrapped around my dick, from the tip to its base.\n",
      "2341 \t I thought there would be one since the other rooms each had one, but... I guess not.\n",
      "2342 \t There was no doubt that she had undergone more than I had...\n",
      "2343 \t I held my breath as I checked things out. Byakuya-san’s footsteps were inaudible after she had slipped into the darkness. I squinted as I continued to watch. She was walking towards the... Yeah, the room with the electric chair... Her figure retreated into the white room. I breathed silently as I waited for a few moments.\n",
      "2344 \t Sensei looked at me. She was nervous, clearly neither smiling nor wearing a peaceful expression upon her face. I won’t say that I chose her because she wanted me to, or because she wanted to take the place of the other girls. I chose her of my own volition, for my own desires.\n",
      "2345 \t The voice went over the usual stuff. We just stood there waiting as it did so.\n",
      "2346 \t ... Wow. I couldn’t help but gulp from seeing her incredibly obscene figure, even though I was the one who tied her up like that. Of course I was going to get aroused from seeing her like that. How couldn’t I? Her legs were spread apart, bound with a rod and rope, and her wrists were bound together with a rod as well. She could barely even move, let alone hope to hide her exposed genitals from my view as a result of her legs being spread apart like that. She knew all too well what this meant. Escape was futile, and that’s why she didn’t attempt to. All she could do was endure the humiliation as she quivered slightly.\n",
      "2347 \t The third unlocking ended.\n",
      "2348 \t A momentary reprieve. I wanted to rest my head and body as much as I could. But thirty minutes would pass by in a flash if I closed my eyes for a bit.... I’m tired. I approached the monitors and brought up the rules.\n",
      "2349 \t The door opened. I approached Sensei and took her hand, pulling her along as we headed for the individual room.\n",
      "2350 \t I let go of Sensei’s hand once we entered the room.\n",
      "2351 \t I bound her body using the rope that was in the box. She couldn’t move, and she was in an incredibly arousing position.\n",
      "2352 \t I untied the ropes from Sensei’s limp body and tossed them back into the box.\n",
      "2353 \t I approached her.\n",
      "2354 \t We both asserted that we would participate at roughly the same time.\n",
      "2355 \t The door shut the moment we entered the room. A box was waiting for us in the middle of the room. I recalled what happened last time. The bonus game’s instructions were much different from the unlocking I had done before... Will it be the same this time around? It’d be nice if I could take the lead...\n",
      "2356 \t I mean, I’ve seen it plenty of times already, but she’d probably be embarrassed before we actually start. She tended to lose herself once we got going, but I did like how she got all embarrassed at first.\n",
      "2357 \t I tried to resist, but she had my head completely pinned down. I couldn’t even move.\n",
      "2358 \t We returned to the main room. And Makiba promptly rushed up to us.\n",
      "2359 \t  with a luxurious room like this.\n",
      "2360 \t Our faces were drawn to one another, and our lips met.\n",
      "2361 \t Without warning, the lights shut off as we embraced each other. Night had arrived.\n",
      "2362 \t She opened her eyes and yawned.\n",
      "2363 \t I looked over at her. Not even a hint of fear was present upon her face.\n",
      "2364 \t The door closed.\n",
      "2365 \t ..................\n",
      "2366 \t ..................\n",
      "2367 \t Sensei comforted Makiba and Kanae by wrapping her arms around their shoulders. She didn’t explain why she knew everything would be over. All she was doing was just saying it’d be fine like always, but...\n",
      "2368 \t We all did our own thing during the final interval. Sensei went to the dormitory with Kanae and Makiba.... They’d probably return after a little bit. It was our last chance to gather evidence, after all. I guess I could do some investigating myself before Sensei gets back.\n",
      "2369 \t Sensei came out of the dormitory after a little bit. We went past the numerous barrier doors and stood before the final one before heading back.\n",
      "2370 \t We moved to the individual room.\n",
      "2371 \t The \"voice\" confirmed our entrance.\n",
      "2372 \t I put the key back in the box.\n",
      "2373 \t I half-turned to the voice before stopping. I shouldn’t get too involved. That was for everyone’s sake, but more than anyone else’s, for my own.\n",
      "2374 \t Makiba was clearly dejected. Apparently she was quite upset about not being able to use the VIP room.\n",
      "2375 \t Kanae’s kind looks were contrasted by her stubbornness. That’s why I said that in a cold tone as I turned my back to her. She wasn’t so insensitive as to go counter to my assertive attitude.\n",
      "2376 \t ... I wasn’t so fussy as to choose to sleep somewhere away from everyone else. All I needed to do was stay quiet and lay down.\n",
      "2377 \t ... I didn’t talk to anyone. Also, I probably shouldn’t get near Nemu anymore. I just needed to stay quiet and wait for the time to pass. Just sit still and wait...\n",
      "2378 \t Makiba quietly muttered those words.\n",
      "2379 \t Makiba and Kanae went to the dormitory. Nemu and Sensei were talking to one another. Byakuya-san... wasn’t here. Maybe in the dormitory? I decided not to go to the dormitory. I just lay down by the wall near the door and closed my eyes.\n",
      "2380 \t I sat up off the floor.\n",
      "2381 \t We could make it to the surface. Just a bit more. I continued to climb up the hill with trembling legs. I gripped Kanae’s hand behind me as I continued to climb, facing towards the outside. Just a bit more... and we’d make it... I could see the exit... Was it... night time...? I was sure we’d be able to see the stars if the sky was clear, though... Just a bit... more... A forest... I saw the silhouettes of trees, and I could hear the rustling branches. We were in the middle of a mountain.\n",
      "2382 \t I blinked a number of times before casting my gaze around.\n",
      "2383 \t I ran. I ran as far as I could. My legs wouldn’t stop. A sense of urgency and trepidation controlled my mind and body. I was chasing after someone, but at the same time I felt like I was being pursued. I was confused. The \"me\" from the distant past, the recent past, and the present all existed at once. Our consciousnesses mixed together and then broke apart. Any chain of reasoning ceased to exist, leaving me with just the moment. Run. Chase after them. Escape. Get out of here. I gotta catch them. I can’t be caught. So run. Run, run, run, run!\"Where\" was I? \"When\" was I? What was bottom, what was top? Where was I? I couldn’t get a grip on anything. Was I standing? Was I sitting? Did I have feet? Did I have hands? I didn’t know. But I ran, because that was all I could do. It was like I was struggling in midair. I was dizzy. I felt like I was going to throw up. My head spun. The WORLD spun. Gravity was nowhere to be found. I ran and ran, but I wasn’t getting anywhere. There was no meaning to my actions. We gotta run, we gotta get out of here, otherwise we’ll die. Otherwise we’ll be killed. So hurry! Hurry up and find me! Find the me that’s running! Find the surface I’m running on! Hurry, hurry, hurry! My feet touched the ground.\n",
      "2384 \t I closed my eyes, took a deep breath, and then exhaled.\n",
      "2385 \t The fallen leaves rustled beneath my feet as I stood up. A fit of happiness began to well up within me, making me feel like I was about to burst out laughing.\n",
      "2386 \t The light in the distance went out as I walked. Instead, I caught glimpses of a large concrete building’s silhouette between the trees.\n",
      "2387 \t  in my life. Just like I said in that white room. I abandoned her.\n",
      "2388 \t Was I having a nightmare? I couldn’t speak. It was like my tongue had been pulled out of my mouth. I couldn’t move. It was like my feet had been rooted to the ground.\n",
      "2389 \t —Her voice shook my eardrums from a distance.\n",
      "2390 \t Byakuya-san placed her hand on the curtain after advancing through the stage’s wing. Nemu was waiting beyond there.\n",
      "2391 \t Someone stood before me as I squirmed about on the floor. I didn’t recognize whatever shoes they were wearing.... Who was it? It wasn’t a student. I had never seen those shoes before... Ahh, fuck... I’d know who it was if I could just lift my head up... There was no doubt about it, though... Whoever was wearing those shoes was... The perpetrator behind the nearly instantaneous elimination of Byakuya-san’s group. The shoes suddenly disappeared from my field of view.\n",
      "2392 \t I just looked ahead in the dark. I had no idea what time it was, and the clock in the classroom was broken, so it was of no use. There were so many things I needed to think about... So much... What I would do from here on... Kanae... And I was worried about Byakuya-san, too.\n",
      "2393 \t Hah, hah, hah... Hahah... Hah... Hahah... Hah... Hah...! I ran. I ran as I pulled on someone’s hand. I had to escape. Or else we’d be killed. Just what had the world come to? Was this really our school? One of my classmates was killed before my eyes. And we would be too. Death waited for those that got in the way. Death waited for us if we were caught.\n",
      "2394 \t I was covered in sweat.\n",
      "2395 \t ..................\n",
      "2396 \t The lookout removed the handcuffs from me.\n",
      "2397 \t I quietly slipped out of the cave’s room. It was filled with maniacal ecstasy and excitement, all focused on Byakuya-san. No one was actually paying attention to me.\n",
      "2398 \t There was a door fit into the cave before us. It was clearly different from the other rooms in the cave. Was the equipment necessary to take the collar off behind this door?\n",
      "2399 \t After much walking, night had arrived by the time we reached the school. Walking through the rugged mountain with someone on your back was unbelievably taxing. Shrieks, cheers, and moans could be heard throughout the campus, despite it being evening... No, because it was evening. I carried Byakuya-san to the gym, dragging my trembling legs along. She would be a sacrifice.\n",
      "2400 \t Makiba’s hysterical screams echoed throughout the gym.\n",
      "2401 \t ... My head and body felt incredibly heavy. Disgust and arousal welled up within me, both in body and mind. Why couldn’t it just be one or the other...?\n",
      "2402 \t A dry sound echoed twice in the distance. No one immediately realized that those were gunshots. Not even me.\n",
      "2403 \t My sense of reality came flooding back to me after I said that aloud. I got up and leaned against the wall, sitting crossed legged. The handcuffs around my wrists clanged together.\n",
      "2404 \t Why were there so many of them? They all seemed fidgety, too...\n",
      "2405 \t I couldn’t say the rest. The wall of the boy’s toilet was filled with brand new concrete, just around where Byakuya-san was. Her body was completely buried inside in a contorted position.\n",
      "2406 \t Nemu questioned me the moment I left the boys’ bathroom.\n",
      "2407 \t Why did she suddenly say that? What ulterior motive was she hiding?\n",
      "2408 \t I was taken back to the classroom. There seemed to be more lookouts in the hallway than before. Probably because their position as lookouts would be at risk if they let me escape. Not only that, but they’d undergo some extreme torture if they let me escape. It was no surprise they were desperate. The chain linked to my handcuffs was long. I could move to about the center of the classroom. I walked toward the classroom door and touched it. I tried pulling on it, but it didn’t even budge, of course. Some sort of wooden rod or something must’ve been blocking it.\n",
      "2409 \t I was called to the gym. Kanae was taken there before me. The cage beside the gym’s stage seemed like it was designed to hold a ferocious animal... Yet Kanae was in there.\n",
      "2410 \t There was a dog house in the gym. It was an actual dog house, big enough to fit a person of small stature.\n",
      "2411 \t Nemu approached me.\n",
      "2412 \t Thinking and doing are completely different things. I was fine with leaving all of that restricted to the quagmire of my imagination.\n",
      "2413 \t I was brought back to the classroom from the gym. It was tough to chat with the lookout since the door was shut. I sat in the corner of the classroom. My next opportunity to talk with one would be when they brought me my meal. I had no intention of attempting to escape, of course. I just closed my eyes and waited for night to fall. There was something I needed to check...................\n",
      "2414 \t Two lookouts led me back to my room. This whole time I was forced to watch Nemu toy with the other students on campus. I was tired... More mentally fatigued than physically, though. Just how long would this life continue? Just how long could I last?\n",
      "2415 \t Here...\n",
      "2416 \t Nemu called me to the gymnasium. Kanae went before me. She was back in the cage. Nemu didn’t seem to show any indication of being suspicious about my contact with Byakuya-san. But this was Nemu, after all. I had no idea what she was thinking.\n",
      "2417 \t She whispered into my ear.\n",
      "2418 \t I stopped myself just before I screamed Kanae’s name.\n",
      "2419 \t ..................\n",
      "2420 \t Her followers tied me up and threw me face up onto the classroom floor. Nemu and I were the only ones in there, though.\n",
      "2421 \t My body was burning up. It felt like magma would spew out from my every pore. The heat amassed in one particular spot, though. My dick. It was unbearably hard, seemingly ready to tear through the thick material of my pants at any moment. Nemu removed the tightly wrapped rope binding my body. But she quickly used that rope to tie me up in a different fashion. One preventing any movement on my part... while simultaneously rousing her own enjoyment. I was her subservient slave, bound by hand and foot.\n",
      "2422 \t I opened my eyes to find Kanae looking at me with a concerned look on her face. I got up. The restraints around me were removed at some point. I was even wearing a new set of clothes.... Kanae must’ve changed them. She had taken such good care of me.\n",
      "2423 \t Kanae stayed with me. I was restless for some reason, despite how exhausted I was. We both sat on the classroom floor with our backs leaning against the wall as we held hands.\n",
      "2424 \t The two of us leaned against one another with our hands together.... It was so quiet here. The ravaged classroom almost seemed dream-like in its silent state. I leaned against the wall with my legs stretched out in front of me. To the right of my frayed, dirty, torn pants were her slender legs and loafers. In my right hand was a handful of warmth... Her own hand. Momentary peace. The battle would begin anew once dawn arrived. Her kneecaps poking out from her skirt were skinned and dirty. Her socks and uniform, as well, were dirty with dust, mud, and blood. The blood on her clothes belonged to a friend of hers. They bled to death. I didn’t know how long they had lived for while they shed blood.—Having friends murder one another is wrong. Her faint whisper made me grip her hand tighter.\n",
      "2425 \t I quietly sat up.... and then looked at Kanae sleeping beside me. I gently stroked her cheek. Then slowly stood up. Let’s go...\n",
      "2426 \t We darted around the corner and raced up the stairs. Our pursuer was still after us, though. I had to escape. I had to let her escape, at least!\n",
      "2427 \t .........\n",
      "2428 \t I was taken back to the classroom. I heard the lookout closing the door behind me. Kanae was still there, waiting for me.\n",
      "2429 \t The two of us spent the night together without sleeping. We held hands and leaned against the wall. Her legs were right beside my own. I felt like I had witnessed something very similar in the past before... Just when did I have that dream? But that dream was my own memory.\n",
      "2430 \t I wasn’t going to agree to that just to aim for a chance to ■■ Nemu. No! Never! NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER, NEVER! Fucking no! I don’t want to see Kanae suffer or make her suffer anymore.\n",
      "2431 \t I strangled her slender neck.\n",
      "2432 \t I wish I had never seen you make that face and act like that.\n",
      "2433 \t I couldn’t give myself to despair just yet. Think... Keep thinking until the very end.\n",
      "2434 \t ..................\n",
      "2435 \t ... But... I looked at Kanae. Kanae is so kind, so precious to me. She had to go back. She wasn’t fit for this hell. She had to go back to the normal, bright world. But what about me?\n",
      "2436 \t ... Someone... Someone was touching me... What the...? Ahh... Their hand was cold... It was... pleasant.....................\n",
      "2437 \t I hate her... I hate... her... Dammit... Why...? The more I think to myself how much I hate her... The more pathetic I feel...\n",
      "2438 \t I strangled her slender neck.\n",
      "2439 \t I brought my face toward her own. She closed her eyes without responding. I wanted to feel her warmth, even if for just a brief moment.\n",
      "2440 \t I removed my hand from her breast and slowly traced along her labia. Her body reacted as I gently stroked the tiny bulge beneath her underwear.\n",
      "2441 \t We basked in a post-sex glow as we embraced.\n",
      "2442 \t Why was I sleeping here...? Why was Rinne with me?\n",
      "2443 \t Rinne grabbed my shoulder from behind.\n",
      "2444 \t We walked through the forest. There was no indication of anyone pursuing us. Rinne went off the path and started to push her way through various vegetation.\n",
      "2445 \t We both waved to each other as he left. Maybe there were other people I knew here. Let’s take a look.\n",
      "2446 \t .................. I woke up. I couldn’t sleep. Guess I’ll take a walk.\n",
      "2447 \t Everything happened in a flash. The group all charged at her and soon captured Nemu. She was pushed to the ground along with her followers, unable to do anything against the swarm of people. She screamed as the group pinned her down.\n",
      "2448 \t We returned to the cave upon capturing Nemu and her followers. I was exhausted, but we were victorious. There was no reason to live in fear of Nemu anymore. Everyone wore smiles upon their faces, happily embracing or wrapping their arms around each other’s shoulders.\n",
      "2449 \t Thirty minutes later... Rinne’s lecture of sorts began in the most spacious part of the cave after everyone had gathered there. Everyone’s eyes sparkled as they looked at Rinne. It was like they were worshipping a god or something.\n",
      "2450 \t Nemu screamed as the cleansing brand was pressed against her.\n",
      "2451 \t One of her followers beckoned to us. After seeing what happened to Nemu, it was hard to consider escaping as an option.\n",
      "2452 \t She giggled. As though she was enjoying herself. As though she was in absolute bliss.\n",
      "2453 \t Just how much time had passed since Rinne raped me...? All I did was lean against the wall and stare blankly into space. Why did this happen? Why did she change so suddenly? There was no answer, of course. There was nothing I could do besides sit there, dumbfounded.\n",
      "2454 \t I couldn’t gather my thoughts. I had no idea what to do after our failure to escape. Of course, I also had no idea how I was going to be treated after that. There was no way I could possibly plan anything from here on out.\n",
      "2455 \t They weren’t listening to me in the least. They didn’t even seem to realize what they were doing. Why did they believe in this so-called messiah? Why did they believe that I was this messiah’s father? That didn’t make any sense... It was absolute madness.\n",
      "2456 \t My lust was even greater than before. I couldn’t hold back the feeling that was spreading throughout my chest. I shouldn’t... I shouldn’t give into their temptations... I knew that... but...\n",
      "2457 \t ..................\n",
      "2458 \t Was I the oddball, or were they? Before I lost track of who was the real oddball in this situation... I...\n",
      "2459 \t How long had I been locked up like this for? Kanae brought me food every day. And it was the number of times she brought me food and...... The number of those repulsive whipping rituals that indicated how much time had passed.\n",
      "2460 \t Perhaps I’d die like this. Perhaps my heart would stop from being too drugged up. I wasn’t sure when I started to think like that, but I waited for that moment to happen. I had given up all hope. I knew there was no point in me living like this. I just prayed for Kanae’s safety. That was my sole wish—for Kanae to find somewhere safe and live there in peace.\n",
      "2461 \t I progressed through the gloomy cave with Rinne on my back. Everywhere looked the same. I had no idea where I was going. Rinne was still unconscious, but she could wake at any time. I wanted to get out of here before that happened.\n",
      "2462 \t I didn’t know how to react. I couldn’t immediately accept the fact that it was my fault that she had died. Was I... wrong? Was there a better way to go about this? I knew it was too late to be thinking that, but I couldn’t stop myself.\n",
      "2463 \t I heard Rinne’s muffled voice. I could tell that she was peering down at me with a smile upon her otherwise vacant face. After that... After Rinne took me back... just how much time had passed? I was raped every day without end. I had no idea how much semen I had expended as a result. And by now I had already lost any sense of pleasure.\n",
      "2464 \t I riled myself up as I gazed at Makiba on the ground.\n",
      "2465 \t I got up. My body felt heavy.\n",
      "2466 \t She’s right... Did Nemu abandon us and descend the mountain already? Actually, I didn’t even know if we were on a mountain. I guess I just thought of descending a mountain because I had hoped that this was the forest near our school. Despite not knowing whether this was by our school or not.\n",
      "2467 \t I laid Rika down. I took off her bra, stroking her skin as softly as I could. Then I took off her panties, and she spread her legs herself.\n",
      "2468 \t After resting for a bit, I moved away from Rika and dressed myself again. Then I looked around again. Just what was this place? It looked like some sort of storage, but... I walked around the room. The room was dusty, but it didn’t seem to be in a state of disarray. Even the objects lined across the steel shelf were neatly arranged. Some of the items included cardboard boxes and bottled water. I tried opening up the cardboard box. It was packed with rations, such as canned goods and crackers. There were even first aid kits and flashlights in it. It was like everything I needed was there. I passed by the shelf, approached the door, and grabbed the metal doorknob.\n",
      "2469 \t The light in the distance went out as we walked. I hid my unease as we continued to descend. I was limited by what route I could take since Rika was with me as we descended.\n",
      "2470 \t Nemu took a step forward. She was looking at Rika, not at me.\n",
      "2471 \t Still wrapped and entangled, we were thrown against the ground. My back slammed against the solid ground, causing me to lose my breath for a moment.\n",
      "2472 \t I could barely even tell her to stop crying.\n",
      "2473 \t ... All right. I didn’t feel like I had a fever any longer. I finally felt like I could move around mostly after catching some shallow sleep. I stole a glance at Rika. She was still awake. She was probably planning on letting me lay on her lap the entire night. There was no way that was comfortable for her.... All right.\n",
      "2474 \t Her voice resounded in the destroyed classroom. She clung to me, wrapping her hands around my neck. Her legs swayed helplessly with each of my thrusts.\n",
      "2475 \t After putting our clothes back on, we lay together under a single blanket.\n",
      "2476 \t Alright, it came off! It took a little bit, considering how small and weak Rika was, but it worked.\n",
      "2477 \t I raced through the hallway, calling for Kanae as I opened the classroom doors. No one was to be found, though. What happened to those other students besides Nemu’s followers? Was everyone in the gym?\n",
      "2478 \t ... I walked while blindfolded. I felt like I was walking down some long hallway, headed for my death. I had no idea who was pulling me along. That invisible enemy? Or someone else entirely? What happened to Kanae? What about Rika...? I hadn’t been in contact with them since we parted in the forest. I was stuffed into a bag and passed out after that depressing conversation with Nemu. And before I knew it, I was tied to a chair with rope around my waist, handcuffs, and a blindfold. Once they realized I was awake, someone removed the rope around the chair and made me stand up. Now I was being brought somewhere, like some sort of prisoner... or someone on death row... I wasn’t even sure if I was walking straight. All I could do was advance forward. Something hit against the tip of my shoes. I soon realized it was a staircase. The people around me were waiting in silence. They weren’t going to drag me around, but they weren’t going to take off my blindfold, either.... I slowly went up the stairs. I unconsciously began to count the number of stairs, but soon stopped. I walked around the staircase’s landing and there was another set of stairs followed by another landing. I could tell where I was even though I was blindfolded. It went without saying... It was the school... Just how much higher were they planning on taking me? The people around me silently pulled on the rope around my waist, forcing me to stop.\n",
      "2479 \t I fell onto my knees, and my body went limp.\n",
      "2480 \t I raised my fist at Nemu. She didn’t run away as I swung it down with all my might.\n",
      "2481 \t ..................\n",
      "2482 \t ..................\n",
      "2483 \t Just where was that underground facility? Where was I, anyway? At the top or the bottom? I recalled where I was when I collapsed. The cave led to a forest. The night sky dominated my sight then, which meant that the trees were more sparse than they were here. What else was there? Think...... I think I recall a large boulder. No, not a boulder, a cliff. It was the rocky surface of a mountain’s gentle incline. It goes without saying, but the school I attended was in the mountains. I had many opportunities to walk through the mountain, such as during club activities or orienteering.... The mountain’s rocky surface was more visible near the top of it. At least, provided this was the mountain I was thinking of. Anyway, I needed to get going. I had to advance carefully until the sun was out.\n",
      "2484 \t I tried rolling over, but a cold rock hit against my cheek and woke me up. My eyes darted about as I lay down on my back. It was more of a little tunnel than a cave. How tight it was wasn’t really an issue once I had started lying down, though. I was so glad I dug through that little chasm. It wasn’t a waste of effort. I checked over my body... I still couldn’t move optimally... so it wasn’t a bad idea to continue hiding here. I figured I should press forward, though. I crawled through the tunnel. It was just a straight path, so there was no chance of me getting lost. As I continued onward, the path got wider, and the ceiling got higher.\n",
      "2485 \t I arrived in a considerably spacious cave. It was vastly different from the previous cave and the similarly narrow tunnel. The secret base-like cave felt incredibly small in comparison and was too cramped for someone grown like me. Just what was this, though? A natural cave? I tried to think. The small cave I was in before was beyond the diagonally descending tunnel. Meaning that this was underground. The white facility’s exit was at the top of a hill. It’d make sense if that facility was underground, considering the other features of it. This cave was underground too. Presuming that the facility was somewhere in this mountain, it’d mean that this cave could be connected to it. I cautiously advanced.... I suppose it was used as a natural storage area in the past. It was old, but somehow...\n",
      "2486 \t I poked my head out from the floor and made my way up to the room. I was there... I really made it... I stopped myself from getting too engrossed in that fact and raced for the next door.\n",
      "2487 \t She sneered, showing me a vile grin.\n",
      "2488 \t I saw light in the distance. I followed it. And before long I saw the silhouette of something I recognized as well. It was the backstop for the baseball field.\n",
      "2489 \t Another set of followers moved to both of my sides and bound my arms.\n",
      "2490 \t I lifted her skirt up and placed my hand on her panties without saying a word.... Something felt off, but I didn’t know what exactly. I couldn’t stop myself from doing this, though.\n",
      "2491 \t ..................\n",
      "2492 \t ... Think back.\n",
      "2493 \t We would have to remove the handcuffs and rope around us before we could leave the classroom.\n",
      "2494 \t Sensei placed her hand on my shoulder after I fell silent.\n",
      "2495 \t I had no idea how it had happened, but there I was, standing there like that.\n",
      "2496 \t In truth, I wanted to do that. But I wasn’t going to unleash my desires. I didn’t want to. My dark lust for sexual assault tormented me like some sort of drug. Once I had realized I had such urges, they always remained present, tempting me to let go of my inhibitions. Just recalling how excited and aroused I would get made me feel like I’d lose myself. I wanted to do it, obviously, but I refused. Nemu was like a drug dealer flashing their goods at someone trying to break their addiction.\n",
      "2497 \t Give in...\n",
      "2498 \t My body quaked like it was having some sort of fit. I tried to restrain myself with my arms. My entire body was drenched with sweat. My wet shirt grew colder with every breath.\n",
      "2499 \t She grinned. It was a beautiful, wicked grin... like the sculpture of an artist who sold his soul to the devil.\n",
      "2500 \t I stood before the locked grid door. I could see a number of girls huddled together in the corner of the gloomy cage.\n",
      "2501 \t I wrapped my arms around Kanae’s back. Her warmth and softness terrified me. I felt a tremendous lust for the warm flesh beneath her clothes, for the gentle beating of her heart.... If only I simply wanted to hug her. That wasn’t the case, though. I wanted something else. I wanted to tear through her smooth skin, see her in agony, and force her to scream. I touched her neck.\n",
      "2502 \t My vomit splattered against the ruined floor. The excreta was just stomach juices. A sour scent filled the classroom.\n",
      "2503 \t Nemu called for me, and I was brought to the gym. Kanae was inside of that cage.\n",
      "2504 \t I pushed the woman in the black suit to the floor and made her get on all fours. She didn’t resist getting into that humiliating position, even though she was forced to submit to someone that could never actually defeat her. She didn’t speak at all, but it was obvious from her behavior that Nemu’s orders were absolute.\n",
      "2506 \t Someone was at my feet. Who? It was me. I had collapsed to the floor face up, with a steel beam through my stomach. I couldn’t tell whether I was alive or dead. Two of me existed simultaneously in this space filled with nothing but noise. One standing, and one lying on the floor. Which was real? The dead me, or the one that was alive? The sea of blood before me stung at my eyes while the overwhelmingly real scent of blood stuffed my nostrils. Was this reality? Was this world with the dead me the real one? Was I already dead? Was I just dreaming?\n",
      "2507 \t The guard left a plate with bread and water by the door. I ate my breakfast slowly, savoring the flavor.\n",
      "2508 \t I guess she was saying it was up to me to see if I could send her off peacefully.\n",
      "2509 \t She looked at me with a probing expression. Did she think I was up to something fishy? I didn’t care if she did. I would show her the results soon enough. I won’t say it’s your fault. This was the conclusion I desired.\n",
      "2510 \t Kanae was very beautiful. I slowly took out the soft bits of flesh from her, whispering to her about how beautiful I found her to be. Slowly... So slowly... As though cherishing our first and final encounter.....................\n",
      "2511 \t From an outsider’s perspective, I likely looked like I was just standing there, but that wasn’t the case...\n",
      "2512 \t She was tied up in a boston crab position, placed face up in a square box. I poured the concrete and made sure it hardened in such a way that her hands and legs would be hidden, like a daruma. After that, I placed the thick, concrete slab in a vertical position.\n",
      "2513 \t ..............................\n",
      "2514 \t W-What...? Why...? Why was it white...? What...? Why was I in a white room? Why was I lying down in this coffin-like water tank? Wasn’t I just strangling Nemu in the gym? I felt her neck break with my own two hands... I had a bunch of strange tubes connected to my body, and I was floating in some strange liquid.\n",
      "2515 \t ... But... But what? Didn’t I just say it myself? I had no proof or way of verifying it. I was a total mess in that game. But I wasn’t in pain at all right now, nor was I injured in any way. I hadn’t lost weight, and I was still in perfect physical condition.\n",
      "2516 \t I suddenly shouted as loud as I could. I didn’t need any proof! How the hell could that have been a game?! Those memories were too vivid; the feeling in my hands was too real. How could any of that have been false?! I jumped at the girl who looked like Kanae. That wasn’t Kanae! Kanae was at my school!\n",
      "2517 \t I screamed as I caught sight of the girl who looked like Kanae at my back.\n",
      "2518 \t  to it. The necrotic parts of her body buried in the concrete were replaced with artificial parts. It was clear from the warped figure of her arms that they weren’t her real ones. Her ribcage was visible, and her hips were terribly slender. It was questionable whether she even had any organs still inside of her. Her head was the same as before, though. Her long, silky-smooth hair wrapped around her white body like a snake. No... Was that... some different black hose? Were a number of black, snake-like tubes buried in her back?\n",
      "2519 \t Kanae hugged me, and I clung to her.\n",
      "2520 \t ..................\n",
      "2521 \t I’m... an idiot.\n",
      "2522 \t ..................\n",
      "2523 \t Our farewells were fairly lax, unlike Class Rep’s studious call. This was our normal, everyday thing.\n",
      "2524 \t I blinked. I looked all around the room I was in. Where... was I? Why was I... here?\n",
      "2525 \t Her hand gripped mine. I averted my gaze out of embarrassment.... We always used to hold hands, but since we’d become lovers, I always got embarrassed about doing that. Kanae and I just recently graduated from being childhood friends to... lovers. Well, maybe not graduated, but it was a big change nonetheless. She snuggled her cheek up against my arm.\n",
      "2526 \t  enough for it to feel that familiar. No... It was more like... I just...\n",
      "2527 \t She arched her back laughing like a maniac. I grabbed her shoulders and...\n",
      "2528 \t I believed... I always believed that... I’d be able to meet you... That I’d be able to meet you once again... Always... From ever so long ago. So, so long ago... Always... Ever since then...\n",
      "2529 \t ... Someone was crying. Calling my name. An iron pipe had gone through my stomach. Strangely enough, I wasn’t in pain, even though I should’ve been. It hurt like crazy just a few moments ago... Would I really die? My senses were drifting away.... Don’t cry. Don’t cry. I mean, I don’t want to die... But... I’m glad that... I was able to protect you.\n",
      "2530 \t I blinked a number of times. Kanae was standing before me with a sour look on her face.... Wasn’t I just crying?\n",
      "2531 \t The white room was covered with giant glass panes. I approached the glass wall and looked down. There was an enormous, hole-shaped space below. It was even larger than the school gymnasium. A bunch of researchers in lab coats were bustling about, but they looked like a bunch of ants because of how high up we were. The giant hole brought to mind a temple, and in the middle of it was a large device. It almost seemed like it was an idol.\n",
      "2532 \t The next room was another white room that I had seen so many times. It was empty.\n",
      "2533 \t You taught me about all the wonderful things this world has to offer.\n",
      "2534 \t ..................\n",
      "2535 \t A girl around my age appeared before me. I was surprised... I figured that the person who would be supporting me would be older than me...... I never really had many opportunities to talk with someone my age before...\n",
      "2536 \t I ended up attending Rokukeikan Academy as a transfer student. Kanae said that she was a second year student there.... To say that I wasn’t uneasy would’ve been a lie. Every place I ended up at in the past had turned into a living hell. No matter how peaceful the place was, and no matter how harmoniously the people there lived... they would all succumb to madness and eventually death in the end. It was as though I was some harbinger of death, destruction, and chaos... But I told myself that wasn’t the case. I wasn’t the one bringing hell with me wherever I went. Plus... I always held onto the faint hope that... Perhaps this time... Nothing would happen...\n",
      "2537 \t The breakdown was sudden. A television broadcast was played instead of our usual morning assembly.\n",
      "2538 \t Kanae-chan extended her hand to me. My tears just wouldn’t stop... I bit through my lip. I didn’t care. The pain I felt was of no importance. Blood and tears dripped onto the floor.\n",
      "2539 \t ......\n",
      "2540 \t Nemu slowly lowered herself. Her insides were already wet. She let off a soft moan as she took my dick. She took her time lowering her hips onto my lap. The entrance of her vagina snugly wrapped around the base of my penis. She let off a dreamy sigh.\n",
      "2541 \t She bashfully extended her hand to me. I gripped her hand. We would walk back to the dorms while holding hands.\n",
      "2542 \t ... This was perfect. So long as Nemu was happy. The uncertainty I felt lingering in my chest would eventually fade away. And just being with her...... would be an even easier task than closing my eyes. I would grant her wish. Let’s stay in this world of bliss together, forever. I wouldn’t hesitate any longer. I would never let go of your hand ever again. I would live for you and only you from now on, Nemu.\n",
      "2543 \t Nemu... She seemed so overjoyed. She seemed so happy. She was... so important... so irreplaceable to me. I’m sorry I ever forgot about you. Let’s always stay together. Right by each other’s sides. I gripped her hand tighter.\n",
      "2544 \t We walked through the darkness. I felt nothing besides the hard surface at my feet. I just walked forward through the total darkness. All the while, I pulled Nemu along. My sense of direction was useless. I couldn’t tell where we were walking, or what sort of space we were in. It was impossible to tell just how far we had walked. But I kept on walking. I wouldn’t stop.\n",
      "2545 \t —... I was in a white room when I woke. I glanced over at my side. The glass tank next to me was empty. I slowly stood up.\n",
      "2546 \t I felt like I heard someone quietly breathing for a moment. I listened carefully and headed in the direction of that sound.\n",
      "2547 \t I wasn’t even sure where I had exited from after I advanced forward a few meters. I stood by myself in the forest. I couldn’t help but stand there for a bit. It took me a while to realize that I was finally outside.\n",
      "2548 \t ...*Open*... *Close*.\n",
      "2549 \t ......\n",
      "2550 \t ......\n",
      "2551 \t I stepped foot into an alley. The alley was dark, despite it being daytime. I could hear someone’s faint voice.\n",
      "2552 \t Nice to meet you. My name is Asou Ei. Thank you so much for purchasing and playing Euphoria. I was in charge of planning and the main scenario this time around. This was my first time really writing the majority of a game’s scenario, so it was a profound experience. There were a lot of things I was planning on talking about, but now that I have the opportunity to I can’t really find the right words to say. It was a pleasure to be able to work with Hamashima-san (character designer), Akutsu-san, who was kind enough to say let’s make this game (that would surely be divisive) together, and CLOCKUP for taking on this project. I know that this game isn’t anything special, but I hope that it’ll leave some sort of impression on everyone who played it, if even for just a brief moment. Until next time.\n",

      "7542 \t I’m being called.\n",
      "7543 \t The night of August 31st arrives.\n",
      "7544 \t The next morning— While I was sleeping, I received a text from Yuki. ‘I guess school starts tomorrow at Teito Nursing. I’m so jealous. Once I get well, I’d like to study there as well. I want to study a lot. When I get there, please teach me the ropes, Asuka.’\n",
      "7545 \t The summer vacation homework review tests go on for about a week. They’re held every day, for the first half of each class.\n",

      "7552 \t With the odd tension remaining, time passes until finally school ends—\n",
      "7553 \t About a week passes, when one day...\n",
      "7554 \t ...And, just like I was always warned, I caught a cold. The next morning my temperature is 37.2 degrees.\n",
      "7555 \t Then, on the day of the annual school festival .\n",
      "7556 \t I open the somewhat heavy door and step out onto the roof. There appears to be no one up here. Within the school building, students are busy cleaning up after the displays and attractions. It’s loud enough for me to hear them from here.\n",
      "7557 \t I blink, my body tense.\n",
      "7558 \t The next day.\n",
      "7559 \t Time passes. Ceaselessly the river flows, they say—(source unknown.) Spring.\n",
      "7560 \t May— Ms. Ohara’s voice floats through the quiet classroom.\n",
      "7561 \t —That night I dream of something. The next day, when I wake up, my recollections of the dream are hazy and I hardly remember anything of it. Only that it seemed like a memory from long ago. I think I was meeting someone in my dream... \"Alright, let’s call you—\"\n",
      "7562 \t One rainy day...\n",
      "7563 \t ...\"\n",
      "7564 \t After this, a few days pass uneventfully.\n",
      "7565 \t As I enter the room saying this, Nao shows her face from the kitchen.\n",
      "7566 \t \"What about you? What’s your name?\"\n",
      "7567 \t ...Around this time, I hear from Miss Sakuya that she’ll be \"voluntarily repeating the year.\"\n",

      "7572 \t Looking at it again, I just can’t believe it.\n",
      "7573 \t I open the door.\n",
      "7574 \t The next few days, up until the week after that... They’re completely ordinary schooldays....Though the classes are tough. But duty is duty. And, once again...\n",
      "7575 \t And again, school life goes on. And once more... One week after we met at the karaoke place—\n",
      "7576 \t And... Coming to hate Itsuki has started changing some things in me...\n",
      "7577 \t The summer vacation has started. Itsuki has still been commuting to school from home, so our opportunities to come across each other have markedly decreased. I sometimes get emails from her with titles such as ‘We have to talk,’ but I’ve been ignoring all of them. I’m just immersing myself every day in my mountain of school tasks. —One evening.\n",
      "7578 \t I’m rolling around in my bed. Holding my smartphone in my hand, I open my message history. There are several texts which I sent to Itsuki, but not a single reply. The tables have been turned. In the past, I was the one who ignored her.\n",
      "7579 \t After classes have ended, I head towards Itsuki’s and Miss Sakuya’s room. I stand in front of the door and ring the bell.\n",
      "7580 \t The speakers announce that the event has reached its closing time. The remaining people in the hall all join each other in a round of applause. Clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap clap— My friends’ magazines were already sold before afternoon, so they already cleaned up their things and went to check out the rest of the event, since they didn’t have anything else to do.

      "7590 \t I start running. I can’t possibly stay still after this. I don’t even know why I’m running. I don’t even know where I’m running to.\n",
      "7591 \t Sakuya is carried to a room on another floor.\n",
      "7592 \t Sakuya told me to do it \"with love.\"\n",
      "7593 \t Many years later—\n",
      "7594 \t I’m also sad that Sakuya is going to disappear. I also feel that a world without Sakuya will lose its meaning. I want to be with her forever. I don’t want to go on without her.\n",
      "7595 \t \"Good job, sis.\"\n",
      "7596 \t The next morning, I’m heading to school with Nao.\n",
      "7597 \t Ms. Ohara is explaining today’s training. When she’s teaching in front of the class like this, she really seems like the ‘perfect nurse ’, whichever way you look at her. Though... she’s now my girlfriend, isn’t she?\n",
      "7598 \t After class. Because I failed a small test, I’m having to stay behind to retake it. Ms. Ohara is on the platform. We’re the only ones in the classroom. All my classmates have either gone home, or are doing voluntary practice in the training room. Ms. Ohara and I are the only ones in the room. It’s just us....Well, it’s not like I failed the test on purpose. I really didn’t.\n",
      "7599 \t And life goes on like that. Me and Ms. Kaede... Yes......For example, when going home after classes.\n",
      "7600 \t It’s not unusual anymore for me to spend evenings at Ms. Kaede’s house. I almost feel as comfortable there as in my own dorm room.\n",
      "7601 \t It’s December now, and winter has begun. I’m studying at Ms. Kaede’s house.\n",
      "7602 \t The following day. During lunch break, I’ve called Nao, Miss Itsuki, Machi and Michi - all the people who know about me and Ms. Kaede - to the roof, and explained to them the situation. Miss Sakuya is at home and taking a break from school. She’s apparently having a tough time.\n",
      "7603 \t And— It’s finally Christmas Eve.\n",
      "7604 \t I heard from Ms. Kaede later on what she did after that. She went home, read the letter once more, and cried again. Then, she checked the phone number at the bottom of the letter. She told me she hesitated, but called the number.\n",
      "7605 \t This must be a miracle of love. Time passes by, and we’re now in the autumn of my second year— It’s the time of the Capping Ceremony, which we were only allowed to watch from the sidelines last year, as first year students.  This year, it’s finally our turn. Is this the finish line? No, I feel rather that I’ve finally made it to the starting line. The curtains in the hall are closed, and a solemn atmosphere fills the area. We’re sitting in a line in front of the platform, and just like we had been last year, the first year students are sitting in a line behind us.\n",
      "7606 \t —I let go of the envelope.\n",
      "7607 \t But why—...?\n",
      "7608 \t And the seasons keep on turning...\n",
      "7609 \t Today's finally my first day! This is the hospital I work in. It's about a five minute walk from the dorm. Yurigahama General Hospital. It has departments of surgery, internal medicine, and long-term treatment. I'm in the internal medicine department. I've taken care of patients before in nursing school, but nursing while studying as a student and nursing while getting paid for it as a professional are totally different. I've got to do my best! Your every decision and action can drastically affect the lives of your patients and their families. That's what my nursing teacher would always say... It's only been two weeks since graduation, yet school feels so distant somehow. I sure met a lot of people at school... I wonder what kind of people I'll meet here?\n",
      "7610 \t I thought I'd be able to figure things out once I got inside the hospital, but I was totally wrong. First, the receptionists notice me when I step inside, but they give me a suspicious look. So much...stink eye...! Why are they looking at me like that? ...Urgh, they're looking at me and whispering something to each other... I listen in closely and pick up their conversation. \"I've never seen her before. Who is she?\"\n",
      "7611 \t Do I need to be shown around the ward...?  No thanks. I'd appreciate it.\n",
      "7612 \t I dive into bed the second I get into my room! It's so nice and soft... Maybe it's just because it was my first day, but I'm just so...beat. My energy's dropped to zero. Oh, but I can't just go to sleep like this... I drag myself up, for starters. Then, I change into my pajamas and vacantly sit down. So, the Chief brought me to the administrator's office......but I had no idea there would be so many documents to fill out! And no one told me it would take all morning and some of the afternoon! What's worse, the Chief just left me at the office. She said she had work to tend to and cruised right back out. The administrator was nice enough to let me go back to our floor when lunchtime came around, but......I had no idea where the staff cafeteria was, and I hadn't brought any lunch, either. Someone let me know that there's no cafeteria, and when I looked for the hospital shop to buy lunch, there wasn't one of those, either! I knew that there was a convenience store about fifteen minutes away from the hospital, but going out there was the last thing I wanted to do. I felt like I couldn't go out shopping in my nurse uniform. So then, I could change to my regular clothes in the changing room, take a thirty minute round trip, and change again... Would I go outside for lunch, or stay in the hospital and skip it? It was the ultimate choice. And as the tears welled up, Senpai said she would give me some of her lunch, but...\n",
      "7613 \t At the first floor lobby. Moving to a different floor is kind of annoying, but it's still really convenient to have a vending machine in your building. The convenience store IS a little bit far.\n",
      "7614 \t I hear a sound coming from somewhere... I think it's... My alarm...?\n",
      "7615 \t She hands me a transparent polyethylene bag. A...a convenience store bag?\n",
      "7616 \t An...i-infection...? I get it... Since our patients' immune systems are so weak, they'd be vulnerable to whatever bacteria our hands happen to have hidden on them.\n",
      "7617 \t We roll the cart out to room 301, the intensive care room.\n",
      "7618 \t Someone hugs me from behind. W-Wait, I'm still in my underwear! Did a pervert break in here?!\n",
      "7619 \t Today's my second day in the ward! It's actually my third day, but I barely worked on my first day, so that doesn't count. But... Even though I worked yesterday, I still have no idea what a normal workday is like. This is totally different from job training back in school. I ran into Senpai when I left the dorm in the morning, so we went to the changing room and the nurses station together. You know...I could get used to this.\n",
      "7620 \t Answering nurse calls is my job as a newbie. But...I'm a little scared to answer it... My mind can't help but imagine making more trouble for my patients and coworkers.\n",
      "7621 \t When I'm on my way back to the nurses station, someone calls to me from behind.\n",
      "7622 \t It's my fourth day since coming to the ward.\n",
      "7623 \t Someone smacks me on the back while I'm writing my report. It actually made me cough, but even worse...\n",
      "7624 \t Senpai is totally beat. Well, of course she would be. On top of her regular work, she has to take care of me, too. Yamanouchi told me not to put too much pressure on senpai by asking other people for help in the afternoon, but... Urgh...I... I might have asked Senpai for everything.\n",
      "7625 \t Mr. Ryukaku...he had heart failure, right? He's a pretty scary old man, too...\n",
      "7626 \t Senpai and I exchange looks in front of room 306 and nod at each other with big smiles.\n",
      "7627 \t A dark, dark world...            Where am I...?           Am I in an ambulance?     Oh...when I think about it,     I was in a car accident as a kid, wasn't I.     But I don't remember anything from that.     I was still in elementary school and sustained severe     injuries, so my memories got scrambled...and I probably     don't want to remember it, either.  The flurry of confusing events might have made me forget...  or it might have been side effects of the anesthetic.  ...But lately,  I can't help the feeling that  I've forgotten something important.   However, I have no idea what I forgot,   and that just worries me to no end...      That's probably where my androphobia came from, too. My mother tells me that, after my accident, I grew terribly afraid around adult men, but I have no idea why...         ...It just might be...this image,         hiding away in my mind.      This man with a tense, fearsome face is tucked away      in a corner of my head.  I think that man is at the core of my fear  of men as a whole.  I wonder if that terrifying man was in the car that hit me?  Is that why he's stuck in my head...?         But no matter how much I think about it,         I can't remember a thing.         My absent memories provide no answer.        ...But        the fear that bubbles up        from that void just won't leave me...              \"Kaori.\"\n",
      "7628 \t Morning already...? Huh? Morning...? Wait, did I fall asleep again?!\n",
      "7629 \t After waking up from my impossibly long nap in the evening yesterday, I found a message from Senpai waiting. It said that they were having a welcome party for me tomorrow. It would be in a bar near the hospital. Attendance would be free. According to Senpai, events like this were under \"station expenses.\"\n",
      "7630 \t Today's the start of my second day on the job! There's still not much I can do, but I at least want to support the other staff! Like, I can clean up the desk if it's a bit messy, or be the first one to take a nurse call.\n",
      "7631 \t Come to think of it. I think the posters that are always in the hall are really cute. And there are pictures of popular cartoons and game characters in 306, the children's room. Does the hospital get those from professionals?\n",
      "7632 \t I've finished up my vital checks, so now I just need to do my report... I'm not looking forward to it at all... Writing reports is still a task I'm nowhere near mastering. I mean, I just can't write them well. How am I supposed to pen a record that anyone would understand easily? I haven't even fully grasped the patient's conditions yet; how could I possibly write a report that the Chief and Senpai would accept?!\n",
      "7633 \t _RE\n",
      "7634 \t Hey, that voice...!\n",
      "7635 \t I stare at my blank record sheet and let out a groan.\n",
      "7636 \t All right... I've done my IV rounds, and I've done the afternoon vital checks... But right then, I hear a loud sound and run off to it.\n",
      "7637 \t I don't want to forget what the patients told me while I did my rounds, so I go over all of it in my head as I return to the nurses station.\n",
      "7638 \t Senpai changes her clothes with a long sigh.\n",
      "7639 \t It's Sunday today. It's Sunday, but I'm at work. I know that hospitals don't have weekends and holidays off, but it's a little strange, being out here at work on a Sunday. The doctors don't come to the ward unless they're called, and the nurses are a little bit more laid back than usual. But maybe I feel like something's missing because Senpai is off today. Though she did send me a message before work, telling me to do my best, eheheh. Time to roll up my sleeves!\n",
      "7640 \t After lunch, we go around the rooms to check on how much everyone has eaten. Unfortunately, Sho in room 306 has a \"1\"\n",
      "7641 \t I come back to the nurses station from a call to find Yamanouchi making flowers. She uses a needle to keep the edges of the origami paper crisp as she turns the paper around while intricately folding it. And before I know it, she's created a beautiful origami carnation!\n",
      "7642 \t It's finally over... And taking off my uniform like this really cements that the day is done.\n",
      "7643 \t I blew it again... Today has been a rampage of mistakes. I was dozing off during the morning reports, I tried to put the wrong drugs in the IV bag even after the double check......then, I was accidentally rude when answering a nurse call, and the patient was really mad at me... I went to apologize, but I probably won't be forgiven for a while. Ahhh, I totally blew it...\n",
      "7644 \t Since I have a bit of time, Senpai and I are visiting the examination and x-ray rooms. We're on patrol, making our rounds.\n",
      "7645 \t I finished my IV rounds, and I did all my vital checks. The ward's been awfully calm today. It's nice to just kind of relax like this. Senpai's off today, so I have to work really hard alone, but...at this rate, I think I'll be okay.\n",
      "7646 \t The Chief laid into me for being too laid back last week, so I've got to be more proactive on the job! I'm not going to get chewed out for that again!\n",
      "7647 \t I've gotten pretty used to the job. Even some patients comment on how far I've come, so I must be doing something right. Like, I can take care of Mr. Otai when he's vomiting by myself now. And I'm a lot smoother with my reports now, too. I get to the nurses station table, quickly write up a report, and do a big stretch.\n",
      "7648 \t Nagisa and I are going about the ward, checking patients' vitals, when...\n",
      "7649 \t Two days after the diaper incident, I find myself on lunch break with Yamanouchi.\n",
      "7650 \t It's the weekend today, so the normally busy outbound patient ward is very quiet. All I can hear are my plodding footsteps echoing throughout the hall, and it's a little scary......but what am I getting all scared about in the middle of the day? I'm on my way to the examination room to pick up some test results, but I notice Ami sitting alone on a bench in the empty waiting room.\n",
      "7651 \t I stop writing my report and get up to follow Senpai out of the nurses station, but...\n",
      "7652 \t When afternoon came around, a message came in asking if there were any records left in the ward of patients who had already been discharged. We happened to find said records, and since I was free, I went down to the outpatient ward to deliver them to the receptionist...\n",
      "7653 \t I bought the Chief a souvenir yesterday, but I haven't had the chance to hand it to her. Before I know it, it's already evening. I can't help but feel like handing it to her when other people are around is like handing her a bribe, and I really wouldn't that that...so I've been trying to get alone with her. But the more I watched the Chief, the more I noticed that her job wasn't to just stay in the nurses station. It seemed surprisingly tough. I mean, I didn't think she'd have an easy job, being the chief nurse of a medical ward. But it's a lot worse than I thought... While writing some document at the doctor's desk, the Chief seems to consider something, stand up, and head for the break room.\n",
      "7654 \t _RE\n",
      "7655 \t I decided to come to work a little earlier today. I have the colored pencil set that I bought yesterday in my hands. I just hope she likes them...!\n",
      "7656 \t I don't even know what to write! I've been staring at a blank piece of paper this whole time! Ahh, if only I could just lash out like that...! But the reality is I just don't have the skill to pull this off. Ahh...\n",
      "7657 \t ...Huh?\n",
      "7658 \t I head towards room 306 with more of a skip in my step than usual. I hadn't even been aware of the goofy grin on my face. I looked so goofily out of it that the Chief scolded me and told me to get serious, Yamanouchi mocked me, and Senpai just didn't know what to say. But I can't help it! I'm just so happy!\n",
      "7659 \t Yamanouchi sounds awfully pleased....So, I'm helping Yamanouchi after work again. Today, I'm doing this process where I have to fill in places she's marked with an \"x\"\n",
      "7660 \t Today's another busy day at the hospital. People must have poured into the hospital after Golden Week, because it's packed! And what's worse, even though I'm busy enough, I find Mr. Otai vomiting while I'm doing my IV rounds! I leave the IV rounds to Senpai and Yamanouchi and tend to him. Room 302 is a doubles room. Both the patients are men, and since I'm a bit afraid of men in general, I wondered if I could pull off taking care of them. But my uniform might have worked its magic on me, because I felt like I forgot that I was dealing with a man, and that I was afraid of men. And I think that I just might have properly nursed him. I mean, Mr. Otai did thank me with a smile before I left. So I came back to the nurses station to write my report before I forgot, but...\n",
      "7661 \t When I pick up the prescription sheet, the Chief looks up.\n",
      "7662 \t The night shift nurses all say goodbye as they leave the nurses station. And as they go, the day shifters start scrambling to their posts to begin the day. Before the Chief leaves the nurses station with a notebook in her hand, I quickly call out to her.\n",
      "7663 \t I find myself groaning in front of a completely blank nurse report.\n",
      "7664 \t Oh, a nurse call. Looks like Yamanouchi's taking it... Yamanouchi signals me with her eyes as she listens to the patient. Could this be...!\n",
      "7665 \t Unlike the nurse call, phone calls to the ward are always to be taken by the Chief or a veteran nurse. If a new nurse like me takes the call, it'll just end up being a confusing game of telephone, so I was told not to answer the phone unless I was the only one in the station. I really want to be good enough to take calls myself, too, so that I can help the ward run more smoothly....I probably won't be as good as the Chief, though...\n",
      "7666 \t Right when I'm about to take the nurse call, I stop myself.\n",
      "7667 \t _RE\n",
      "7668 \t Senpai hurries me, so I put on my clothes as quickly as I can, but I hurry too much and catch my stocking on my leg. Ahhh, there's a run in this expensive stocking Senpai recommended to me...! Argh, why am I so slow getting back to work after a day off?! I'm so dumb! Pressure exudes from Senpai as she stares at the clock, making me hurry even more. After I get all changed through my tears, we both hurry out of the room. Examination time hasn't even started yet, but the lobby is already crowded, with the sofas nearly full. Whoa, there are just so many patients today! The outpatient nurses sure are going to be busy... I hope our ward is quiet today. After looking around a bit, right when I'm about to head towards the stairs, I notice something in the corner of my eye...\n",
      "7669 \t I thought I'd gotten used to Miss Sakai's acid tongue, but...\n",
      "7670 \t Work is over, and I end up having dinner with Senpai in my room....But the reality is, we've already started drinking, and there are already two empty beer cans on the ground. Having a little girl talk sounds good on the surface, but...\n",
      "7671 \t When I stop by room 306, Ami calls out to me.\n",
      "7672 \t Urgh... 311...That's Miss Sakai... I wonder what she could want?\n",
      "7673 \t Work has ended for the day. I take off my uniform and get back into my street clothes, relieved when I do.\n",
      "7674 \t So, I'm on injection duty starting today! Which means that today's evening IV rounds are going to be my injection debut! My heart pounds as I look forward to new activity in my repertoire.\n",
      "7675 \t Writing a report. This is a surprisingly difficult task. I learned it at school, and I'm a good month and a half into the job, but I still can't come up with what to write! The nurse call rings throughout the station. I'm the only nurse in the station, so it feels like it's yelling at me to hurry up and answer it.\n",
      "7676 \t ...Oh, it's happening again...            I'm having that dream again...               Ahhh!              ...It really hurts...              ...It really hurts...           I hurt all over...and I'm burning up...           I can't breathe...my chest is killing me...              \"You...\"\n",
      "7677 \t After getting to a good place in my morning reports, I take a look at the clock.\n",
      "7678 \t I'm eating lunch in the break room with Senpai when Yamanouchi comes in.\n",
      "7679 \t Ahhhh! My reports are finally done!\n",
      "7680 \t _RE\n",
      "7681 \t Yamanouchi looks up from her reports all of a sudden and whispers that.\n",
      "7682 \t I'm tending to my afternoon work when the Chief hurries into the station, seeming tense.\n",
      "7683 \t After being rushed to the hospital last night, Kohaku managed to regain consciousness and is to return to room 306 from today. She seems to have a bit of cranial nerve damage, so she'll have to stay in bed for a few days, but being around familiar faces like Ami and Hiro is keeping her mental state stable. Senpai seems to have really bounced back from her depression yesterday, and she walks through the ward with a spring in her step. And I......I'm the only one who's still dragging it with me.\n",
      "7684 \t Urgh....I have the feeling that lately, when I come back to the station, the nurse call rings...\n",
      "7685 \t As I make my logs for the day in the nurses station, the Chief comes in looking concerned.\n",
      "7686 \t Nagisa asks me as soon as I walk into the nurses station.\n",
      "7687 \t Huh?\n",
      "7688 \t It looks like the Chief's words really hit Senpai hard. I invited her to a pretty classy bar in Kanakura, hoping to have a glass or two with her, but Senpai drank herself under the table... This is why I stopped her, too...\n",
      "7689 \t Ever since the incident a few days ago, Senpai's been on free work duty like the Chief said, and is no longer in charge of a room. I don't really understand what free work duty is much myself, but it refers to all the work that someone does on days that they're not in charge of a room. Nurses have to do a lot of different types of work, and when you're in charge of a room, there's a lot of smaller things you can't really take care of. That's where the nurses on free duty come in -- they take care of what the room nurses can't. Or, so I hear. I guess you could say they run errands? Those errands are surprisingly tough, though. They have to patrol around the outpatient ward, organize medical records, contact the doctors and reserve examinations, as well as a ton of other things. They don't deal with patients directly, but they do really important work. But since Senpai is on the free shift, that means the other nurses and I end up swamped by nurse calls... In fact, most of my time on the job is spent at patient bedsides, and it's becoming harder to sneak out time to write reports.\n",
      "7690 \t Strangely enough, there wasn't any trouble today. Miss Sakai elected not to be nasty today, making it a pleasantly peaceful time....But, well...I couldn't understand the medical terms and abbreviations that one of the part time nurses mentioned, and that was a little embarrassing. I guess that's all that really went wrong. But when the Chief saw that, she clued me in to the terms and abbreviations.\n",
      "7691 \t Mr. Ryukaku's not been well lately. He's been urinating less, and he's been swelling all over. His breathing has been labored, and he'll cough at the smallest exertions -- sometimes with phlegm. The Chief said it was proof that his heart's functioning had fallen. Mr. Ryukaku had electrodes put in his chest, allowing us to view his electrocardiographs 24/7 from the nurses station.\n",
      "7692 \t Oh, look at the time. I've got to go change Miss Sakai's IV. Thanks to her, I've gotten into the habit of doing things ahead of time. And while that's good, well... I just hope she isn't mean to me today. Huh? There's no response?\n",
      "7693 \t The Chief has been sighing all morning. I wonder what's up...?\n",
      "7694 \t I'm doing my rounds in the outpatient ward, at the Chief's orders. She also acknowledged Senpai's efforts, releasing her from free duties and getting her room back! And since Senpai is back on the field, I can do errands around the hospital without worrying! Miss Sakai's the only patient I'm in charge of, so for all of my other duties, I've got to help out around the hospital! I want people to appreciate me being in the ward, even just a little! There've been plenty of orders in the examination room, so the technicians look really tired. G-Good job, all of you... I mean, the surgery data I hadn't gotten yet could barely fit into its holder, and I'm holding an immense amount of data from the internal medicine ward....And when I get back to the ward, I'm going to have to split these up by patient and post them onto their medical records... Thinking about that is a little demoralizing. If Senpai was still on free duty, we could have split this up, too... Ah! Enough of that! Processing exam data is a really important job, and I can't be picking and choosing my jobs! And besides, Senpai getting busy with taking care of her patients suits her a lot more! I shake my head and get back into work mode.\n",
      "7695 \t Urgh... So sleepy... Can't keep my eyes open.\n",
      "7696 \t I'd gone to address an injection extraction call, and got chewed out because the bleeding region hurt... Even though I didn't set the needle in the first place. Still, I guess that means the patients recognize me as bonafide member of the staff......Think positive thoughts. Positive thoughts... Things would be so easy if I could...\n",
      "7697 \t It's one of those rare afternoons where I've finished reports early and have nothing to do. I'm going to be pretty free until 3pm when the pharmacy shipment of IV liquid comes in. However, I don't think I'll have enough time to strike up a casual conversation with any of the patients. The patients are usually really bored, so when they get a chance to talk, boy do they talk.\n",
      "7698 \t I went to Mayuki's room again today and talked with her for a bit. As usual, she spoke and acted in a way that felt much too mature for her age, but she does seem to be warming up to me. While there are patients like Miss Sakai who just seem to hate me for no reason, I'm glad to know patients like Mayuki like me. Personal relationships are so complicated, huh?\n",
      "7699 \t Today, no matter what I talk about, Mayuki only seems to listen absentmindedly.\n",
      "7700 \t The Chief and I eat lunch together today. She's opened up to me in private, but when she's in work mode around me, I can't help but feel nervous.\n",
      "7701 \t I'm so...sleepy... How can I work a day shift after an all-nighter? It's impossible! I'm so sleepy that I just went to the bathroom to perk myself up with a face wash. I feel a little better, but give me a break, Yamanouchi!\n",
      "7702 \t Ugh... I can't make any progress on my reports! I slam my head down on the desk, right on top of the blank report sheet.\n",
      "7703 \t Now. I glance down at my watch. It's just about time for me to change Miss Sakai's IV.\n",
      "7704 \t This afternoon is relatively calm. After all that fuss with Mr. Shuseki this morning, I feel like I have nothing to do at all. Hmm... That was all my work for the day.\n",
      "7705 \t It's Sunday! Work is always calm, and I can spend more time with the patients, so I enjoy Sundays. It's nice to relax sometimes.\n",
      "7706 \t The atmosphere in the nurses station has been pretty heavy lately.\n",
      "7707 \t I diligently work through a textbook as I eat my supper. Recently, I've gotten into a pattern of eating supper, washing up, having a bath, and then falling asleep while cramming in bed. I'm studying all the time, and I have to study more because I'm still not where I need to be. I have to study because what I learn eases my patients' suffering. That...and I'm fed up of being useless when the patients in our ward need help. So I study, day in and day out. It's my way of doing right by them!\n",
      "7708 \t I'm studying in the Chief's room after work again today. I invited Senpai, but she said she had something to take care of after work today and couldn't come. What a shame. But still, it's really nice to study with someone like this. I don't end up giving up halfway through, and if there's anything I don't understand, she'll explain it all to me. Thinking really hard about things that are tough to understand just saps my focus. And when my focus is gone, I just lose the will to continue. I know that I need to study, but I just don't have the will! I've already finished all my exams, but I've been cramming for them for a long, long time... But since I'm here with the Chief, whenever my focus starts to fade, she'll give me a really digestible explanation to get me back in the game. It helps me keep my focus, and it deepens my understanding of the subject -- two birds, one stone! And thanks to all that studying, I understand Miss Sakai's illness, aplastic anemia, a lot better. Though the more I learn about it, the more I realize how dire of a disease it is. It kind of gets me down. Sometimes Miss Sakai tries to quiz me and catch me off guard, but I can answer most of her questions thanks to the Chief. I've been really cautious and hesitant around her, but after learning more about what she has to grapple with, I now want her to have a comfortable life in the hospital from the bottom of my heart. But I haven't grasped what symptoms Tsukushi, the girl that Miss Sakai's been getting along with recently, has. She has the same disease as Kohaku, type 1 diabetes. There's two types of diabetes, type 1 and type 2. Type 2 is a lifestyle disease. Type 2 diabetes is a disease you end up with after many years of unhealthy living that reduces your insulin, a hormone that lowers blood sugar. Your blood sugar spikes up, and you end up with this. If some sort of disease stops you early from creating insulin, like Kohaku and Tsukushi, the diabetes you get there is type 1 diabetes. It's also known as juvenile diabetes, and like the name suggests, most of its victims are children. That makes it difficult to care for in its own way. Which is why I'm studying about diabetes today.\n",
      "7709 \t The lights are out in my room. It's as quiet as it usually is. The only sounds I hear are the ticking of my alarm clock and my breathing. Well, usually. Because right now there's someone else breathing, too.\n",
      "7710 \t I take a deep breath of that fresh morning air to expel the last bits of drowsiness in me. All right, time to do my best today! When I let out a big stretch, I notice what looks like a person's outline from the corner of my eye. Huh? Was that...Senpai? I swear I saw Senpai around the stairs... But she wouldn't be there, right? Am I just seeing things? But I wouldn't mistake anyone for her... Her room's on the third floor, and she wouldn't come up here unless she had something to do, right...? Though I'm a little curious, since the elevator just got here, I decide to take it down to the lobby.\n",
      "7711 \t I somehow made it through the day! And boy, am I beat. I've gotten pretty used to work, but there's still so much that I have to learn every day that I can't help but feel anxious. Even though feeling anxious doesn't actually lead to anything good. I mean, I know that, but still... Miss Sakai comes to mind. She's a patient here, but she keeps up with her nurse studies and knows far more than I do. *Sigh*...I sure am sorry, aren't I? I've got my nurse uniform, I've got my license, but it's like I'm no different from when I was just a trainee. I let out a sigh, then shake my head a bit. No. I can't let myself get all negative. Joy'll run out of reach while I'm sighing, so I've got to think of something fun! Let me try and switch gears. All right. I know, what'll I have for dinner tonight? Should I cook, or grab something from the store? Hm? My phone's ringing? I scramble through my bag. Who would call me at this hour? Is someone calling me to the hospital? An unknown number?\n",
      "7712 \t My phone keeps on ringing. Someone is probably watching me from afar... But who? And from where? Why? I start to shake. Uncontrollably. I'm so scared...! Someone, help...!\n",
      "7713 \t ...My consciousness returns. Someone is banging on the door... A few moments pass. I don't hear anything anymore.\n",
      "7714 \t I'm standing in front of Miss Sakai's door.\n",
      "7715 \t Miss Sakai's bite on my arm from yesterday hurts a lot less today. Yesterday really was something. It would have turned into a huge problem if the Chief had seen me, and there was no way I could have shown Senpai, either. So I stealthily dressed the wound all by myself. But...it sure was hard holding the tweezers in my left hand. While I was battling with my arm, one of the part time nurses wandered in, asked if a kid had bitten me, and helped me out. Boy, if she hadn't shown up... It might've been thanks to that nurse's help, but it wasn't too painful in the bath, and when I woke up, it was already a scab. A miracle of the body...and a sign that the wound's gone into the proliferative phase. Er, that is the medical term, right? I'd better look it up...\n",
      "7716 \t Right when I psyche myself up. Someone slaps me on the back.\n",
      "7717 \t Hm...? Who's that...? It's so...so loud here...\n",
      "7718 \t I slowly open my eyes. My phone is ringing. But I don't want to answer it. I'll just leave it ringing... Okay, it stopped....There it goes again. It's ringing again... But I don't want to end up answering a silent call. I'll just keep letting it ring. Oh, it stopped....And there it goes again. Who could it be...? I look at the name on my phone's screen. A payphone. Let me not answer this. But it just keeps ringing. All right, I'll answer it and hang up right away. That should do the trick.\n",
      "7719 \t Hm...someone's here...? I don't feel like getting up, so I'll just ignore them...\n",
      "7720 \t Miss Sakai's verbal abuse has gotten much worse since the sterben of Mr. Shuseki two days ago.\n",
      "7721 \t I'm looking around the hospital ward for Ami because Senpai told me go and ask her how many times she's gone to the bathroom, but she wasn't in her room... I draw up some courage and go into Miss Sakai's room, but she isn't there, either. Hmm... Maybe she's...? Oh, it must be! I find her surrounded by children playing her forteleu. It looks like the children got to her. I think...the reason she was playing quietly was because of the children right near the forteleu. When it's played at a normal volume, it's loud enough to make your ears hurt. They say it can cause hearing loss if you're around loud noises when you're a child, so maybe she's being careful. That's good of Ami. I call out to her when the performance has calmed down.\n",
      "7722 \t The bite Miss Sakai left on me this afternoon starts burning again as work ends. What do I do...? Should I get this checked out? But Yurigahama General is the only nearby hospital, and the Chief would definitely be around at this hour. Which means that she'll find out if I get it checked out here. And I don't even know what to tell the doctor when he asks where I got this bite.\n",
      "7723 \t I couldn't get to sleep after I left Mayuki's room like that yesterday. It's not that I couldn't use circumstantial judgment. I just wanted to let her know that I would willingly give my life for her. So, I head in to work a little early today and go straight to Mayuki's room.\n",
      "7724 \t I'm having a dream.               I'm having a dream.               A scary dream.         It always starts         with the sound of a car horn         and emergency breaks.            Today's no exception.         Then,         a truck rolls out         and hits me.     ...I've been hit by a truck...        ...Are these my body's memories?   Is this a memory of the past that every cell of my body   remembers? The pain of the accident?              And then...              A comfortable place.      This is probably      a near death experience.     If there is an afterlife, anyway.        Then, a voice speaks to me.              \"You must live.\"\n",
      "7725 \t Huh? The Chief's got on a bit of a frown. I wonder if something happened? Well, that aside, time to take care of these reports!\n",
      "7726 \t There's a little adhesive strip on my inner elbow. It's a mark of honor I'm proud of.\n",
      "7727 \t Miss Sakai has a visitor. A pretty woman in her forties. Her hawkish features jump out at me at first, but then I notice the resemblance to Miss Sakai. I wonder if she's Miss Sakai's mother? I shouldn't impose on a precious parent-child moment. I show the visitor to Miss Sakai's room, then circle back to the nurses station. I wonder what Miss Sakai and her mother are talking about right now...?\n",
      "7728 \t The Chief and Senpai are already at the nurses station when I arrive in the morning, discussing something gravely.\n",
      "7729 \t The ward is relaxed this morning, and the nurses station is equally chilled out. Something pops into my mind as I fill out a medical record.\n",
      "7730 \t It's been four days since Miss Sakai was removed from my care. I haven't been assigned any patients so I tend to miscellaneous tasks. The Chief warned me that I get too deeply involved with individual patients. She said I will be assigned patients once I learn to see the big picture. My preceptorship with Senpai is still in place, so I often check in on her patients... But they aren't my responsibility. It's never occurred to me that being patient-less would be so alienating. *Sigh*... I'm hopeless. How many times have I sighed now? The trill of the nurse call brings me to my senses. I check to find it is from Miss Sakai. Yamanouchi assumes responsibility for the majority of Miss Sakai's care now. But she's not in the nurses station at the moment. It's not fair to keep Miss Sakai waiting. I'll sub in for Yamanouchi until she gets back. I pluck up the receiver.\n",
      "7731 \t It's been a day since Miss Sakai collapsed. I can see the friction between the Chief and Yamanouchi deepening from the sidelines. It seems Yamanouchi isn't exactly enthralled with Miss Sakai to begin with. The fact that she takes every chance to call her \"Miss Me\"\n",
      "7732 \t The Chief apprehends Senpai the moment we get back to the nurses station.\n",
      "7733 \t The next day. I was worried about who would be my preceptor in Senpai's absence. Turns out I didn't have to worry... Yamanouchi is selected to replaced Senpai....I say \"selected,\"\n",
      "7734 \t The head nurse, the Chief, and several nurses are gathered in the break room.\n",
      "7735 \t Recently the Chief and Yamanouchi regularly consult each other at the nurses station. Miss Sakai is under Yamanouchi's care now. It sounds like they are discussing how to handle her treatment. Is Miss Sakai's condition that severe? Now that I am no longer responsible for her I'm kept out of the loop...\n",
      "7736 \t I flip through Mr. Toi's reports when something hits me.\n",
      "7737 \t The phone rings the moment I return to the nurses station. The Chief is on it before I even have time to be surprised......Her expression gets darker with each passing second. Has something...happened?\n",
      "7738 \t I'm almost back at the nurses station after dealing Miss Sakai's nurse call when I stop dead in my tracks.\n",
      "7739 \t When I turn up to work the Chief and Senpai are in discussion, their expressions heavy.\n",
      "7740 \t I carefully stake out a stairwell where there's no one around. A child from room 306 passed a letter on to me in the hall a moment ago. The only thing written on it is \"I'll be waiting on the roof\". I didn't ask who it was from, but...\n",
      "7741 \t Ultimately... Miss Sakai transferred to Teito University's hospital. Though my stress has gone down without anyone to hurl constant insults at me......part of me wonders if this was the best ending. As long as I was taking care of her, she couldn't get the kind of service she wants, and this hospital doesn't have the equipment to give her the treatment she needs.\n",
      "7742 \t I slowly open my eyes.           I'm in a quiet place. A place with nothing.         There's a girl standing in front of me.              I don't know her. Her face looks somewhat familiar, but I can't remember where I've seen her.           She's just staring at me,           this elementary school-aged girl.     ...No,     she's not staring.     She's glaring.              With a scary, harsh face.         She looks like she wants to say something,         but she makes no effort to.         Why?         Why do I feel such anxiety in my heart?\n",
      "7743 \t ......              I'm dreaming again.      A sullen-looking girl stands before me.\n",
      "7744 \t ...Huh?      I'm back in that dream again, aren't I?      The girl stands in front of me.     She's staring at me with a look of determination     etched onto her face.\n",
      "7745 \t I'm dreaming again.        But this dream is different from the others.              There's no one else here.              I can't see anything.    All I see is pitch blackness stretching out far before me.              ......           I wander around the darkness,           looking for the little girl.        All of a sudden,        a lonely voice calls out.        \"My big sister was always so different from me,         I was so shy, but she had so many friends.\"\n",
      "7746 \t ......              I'm dreaming once again.            There's nobody else here today, either.            Or is there...?         I can't see them, but I can feel their presence.         \"Hey, is anybody there?!          You must be there, right?!\"\n",
      "7747 \t Ah...           I'm having that dream again...         That girl who's always in my dreams         isn't here today.                 But.     \"You just don't have any courage, sis! Look at you,      you can't even tell the person you love that      you love her! Coward!\"\n",
      "7748 \t Things are going really great with the Chief! We're Chief and grunt nurse at the hospital, but we're a lovey-dovey pair in our private lives! And right now, Hatsumi has on her perfect nurse mask and is working hard. And I'm doing my best to catch up to her as an average nurse who looks up to the Chief.\n",
      "7749 \t It's finally the day of Miss Sakai's transfer to the university hospital. After finishing her preparations, Miss Sakai came to the nurses station herself.\n",
      "7750 \t I haven't been able to love on Hatsumi much since then. I want to go back to our dorm and get busy, but Hatsumi's the Chief, so she often has to bring work home. Which does she care about more? Work, or me?! ...All right, I never want to actually say that to her, but still...\n",
      "7751 \t Senpai and Yamanouchi watch me from afar.\n",
      "7752 \t But... We're on the clock now, so I should avoid personal questions. I'll take my time and ask later, when we're both alone... With that in mind, my eyes meet with the Chief's.\n",
      "7753 \t It's already spring. A year and a half has passed since Hatsumi and I communicated our feelings, and it will soon be two years since I came to Yurigahama. About the time we had just gotten all romantic with each other, an issue was exposed in the surgical ward one floor below us. They apparently had semi-regular problems in the past, so this time they reorganized the staff. The internal medicine ward was as stable as it could be, and with the efforts of Head Nurse Tokiwa, in charge of both the surgical and internal medicine wards, the outpatient ward had calmed down, too. Since things had slowed down, hospital management seemed to have welcomed this trouble with open arms. They handled the lack of staff in the surgical ward with part-time workers and contractors. With the help of Hatsumi, a reliable person she knew as a student became the surgical ward chief. Tokiwa is head nurse of both the internal medicine and surgical ward, and she supports the chief of surgery, so Hatsumi is now virtually both the chief and head nurse of the internal medicine ward, making her very busy. She's always the same when she's working, and the Chief is strict when wearing her nurse uniform. I'm working my hardest everyday because I want to help her. She seems to understand my feelings, and when she takes off her uniform for the day, she's very passionate. \"...Mmm.\"\n",
      "7754 \t It's the same scene I see every morning. The night nurses finish getting ready for their morning reports, and we day workers have our notebooks at the ready, waiting to hear their announcements. It seems like just another day, but it's completely different from usual. That's because today is April 1st. The morning station seems a little intimidating without Senpai around. I won't be able to hear the morning reports with her anymore... Hatsumi, who's become so much more dear to me, isn't here either. She said she was off to get the new nurse at the admin office.\n",
      "7755 \t When I finish my lunch in the break room and go into the nurses station one afternoon, I see Sakai with a bit more of a frown than usual.\n",
      "7756 \t ...... Ahh, my phone is ringing somewhere far off... That annoying voice keeps ringing in my head, so I put my covers over my face.\n",
      "7757 \t An uneventful week has passed since then. Sakai had declared she'd steal one of us away, but she didn't quite do anything. Instead, we enjoyed peaceful days at work. I wonder if the Chief's threat worked? Still, the ward is as busy as ever. I've been phoning Senpai on nights I don't stay over at Hatsumi's room. We've been swapping information, and it sounds like the surgical ward is every bit as busy.\n",
      "7758 \t I quickly look up when I'm called. Senpai isn't there, though. Instead, the Chief looks at me with baffled, cold eyes.\n",
      "7759 \t Augh! Why does she have to be so mean the moment I step into her room?!\n",
      "7760 \t When I'm gathering information in the nurses station before morning reports, Yamanouchi slips right up to me.\n",
      "7761 \t I feel like I wasn't half bad on the job today. Yamanouchi complimented me, and the Chief didn't scold me! Miss Sakai complained at me again, but then again, that's nothing new for her.\n",
      "7762 \t I make the outpatient ward rounds as the Chief requested of me. I got the inspection sheet from the first floor examination room.\n",
      "7763 \t I had absolutely no intention of hurting Senpai. I didn't think I was hurting her. I had no intention of showing off or bragging about my healing hands. I can't believe she hated me that much... I didn't realize any of that.\n",
      "7764 \t I frantically snap awake. I'm in Yamanouchi's room. Yamanouchi giggles and offers me a tissue box.\n",
      "7765 \t I quickly toss together breakfast and plop it on two plates. I pour ketchup on the scrambled eggs. Oh, I should just go ahead and use it to draw a heart. By the time I finish drawing a passionate red heart on the vividly yellow scrambled egg portion of the plate, I can smell the delicious scent of toasted bread.\n",
      "7766 \t I never did get contacted by Senpai yesterday. She doesn't want to see my face anymore, huh? That was shocking to hear, but... But if I think about her feelings, it makes sense she'd say that...\n",
      "7767 \t I don't really know how it happened, but Senpai woke up... I'm so glad she's recovered enough to go out! Whoops, I need to send her my response!\n",
      "7768 \t My heart pounded a bit, but we managed to get to the hospital from the dorm without anyone questioning us. I turn to Senpai beside me, and she winks as if to say, ‘see, that wasn't so bad.’ How many times have I walked from the dorm all the way to the ward with Senpai like this now? And I'm sure we'll be able to keep on going to work together, too! ...But we can only stay together until we get to the stairs.\n",
      "7769 \t It's been three days since Sakai joined the team. And today, as usual, I've finished diaper and IV changes, finished caring for the patients...but I'm writing reports before lunch. Sakai's a lot more skilled than I imagined, and I think this is the first time I've ever been able to write reports so early!\n",
      "7770 \t Senpai's been going back to her room lately, so I really miss her... I'm generally fine when I'm dealing with patients, but when I'm writing my reports alone, my mind wanders places it really shouldn't. Urgh...I probably shouldn't have told her she should go to the bigger hospital......No. No, that's not true. Because that's how I really feel. It's painful to be separated from Senpai, but this is so she can grow! I have to be strong!\n",
      "7771 \t The night that Senpai slapped me on the roof, she came back to my room. My joy lasts only a moment. After apologizing for slapping me and smiling sadly, she starts writing a letter of resignation right in front of me. I know I'm the one who suggested it, but seeing the fact that Senpai was really going to quit...leaves me deeply shocked.\n",
      "7772 \t After that... Things completely went back to normal. With the summary Sakai wrote in hand, Mr. Kato went off to a hospital specializing in dialysis. Sakai cried her eyes out when we saw him off. When I saw her wailing away, I remembered how I used to be when I started the job and couldn't help shedding some tears. Yamanouchi and the Chief watched us with warm smiles. I wonder if sometime, far off, when I'm watching a new nurse see a patient off in tears, I'll be able to look back at today with nostalgic eyes?\n",
      "7773 \t I slowly open my eyes.           I'm in the dark and can't see anything.        ...I'm...inside my dream.   It's a strange feeling,   but for some reason I know that   I am in my own dream. Suddenly a girl floats up right before my eyes.\n",
      "7774 \t Again...              In that dream again...        It's a dream similar to dreams        I've been seeing since a lot time ago...         What on earth could be         the purpose of this dream?\n",
      "7775 \t Miss Sakai's condition is one step forward and one step back. When I think she's gotten better, she'll have a fever. When I think she's not doing well, she'll say she's fine. I knew I wouldn't be able to go by the books with this, but each of her symptoms is just so tough to deal with... Hm? There's no answer. Did she not hear me?\n",
      "7776 \t It's finally the day of Miss Sakai's transfer. We wait for the taxi in the hospital lobby. We don't have many words to share, but it doesn't feel too awkward. Come to think of it, this is where I first met Miss Sakai, down here in the outpatient ward.\n",
      "7777 \t The nurse that comes around hands me a thermometer. I put it under my armpit and pack it in tight.\n",
      "7778 \t The Chief glances over at me. Her eyes share in my relief. And when I start to smile in response... Senpai flings her arms around me.\n",
      "7779 \t Then, after some time...\n",
      "7780 \t ...And with that, Sayuri, having moved into the room next to me, hangs around in my room just about every night. Sometimes she encounters Senpai and the two argue, but they're surprisingly compatible with each other, and we even drink with the three of us on occasion. Though Sayuri can't have alcohol, so she has soft drinks....This. This is happiness. Oh, and... Eventually, the girl that I'd always wondered about, the one who would appear in my dreams, just...stopped showing up. In fact, I don't have that dream anymore, so I haven't met her since. Sometimes, I think back to her. Why did she appear in my dreams? What was she trying to tell me? Sayuri's childhood memories, and the Chief's sister's memories... What did she want to do, after sharing those with me...?\n",
      "7781 \t Miss Sakai is no longer in the acute stage of her condition. It's been about a month since the Chief announced that. Oh, Miss Sakai... I think you should be back by now... Maybe her stay in the university hospital got extended, somehow? Or maybe she's too embarrassed to come back to our hospital.\n",
      "7782 \t How many times have I been to Teito University's hospital by now? How many times have I gone to Teito University's hospital on my day off, only to have a nurse tell me with an apologetic face that Miss Sakai is refusing visitors? The Chief told me around July that Miss Sakai had gotten out of the acute stage of her condition, but transplants are never easy, are they? It looks like she's been feeling consistently poorly for a while. Sometimes she'll call me on the phone, and we'll talk a little bit then, but... She has a slight fever that flares up from time to time, and I'm really concerned about Miss Sakai's energy. That's why I've been holding back calling her myself, but she doesn't seem too pleased with that. She told me that she'd gotten permission from her nurse, so I should just call her whenever, but... Miss Sakai won't tell me about her illness, about how she really feels, about how much pain she's in, but I've heard a lot from her nurse. Does she not tell me about any of this because I'm unreliable? If that's the case, I've really got to pull it together! Hm? A phone call...? And it's from...the ward?! I wonder if something happened?\n",
      "7783 \t I put my finished omelet into a cute paper bag and head to work an hour and a half earlier than usual! There's a bit of a commotion in the ward after breakfast. And it feels pretty strange being here at this time when I'm on the day shift, too...\n",
      "7784 \t Ever since she moved into the room next door, Sayuri's been a part of my everyday life. We can't be together all the time, though. I'll be at work, and even on my days off, she'll sometimes be at school or a training hospital, or finishing up a report. But...I'm not really sure how to say it, but even when we're apart, it feels like she's always by my side. And as time goes by, she becomes a third year student, and the second year of her being my neighbor was about to pass... I think that around January, she got really busy -- studying with me to take the national exam, studying to take her graduation exam...it was a lot. And then, today! Sayuri finally graduated from the Tsubomigasaki School of Nursing! Though I wasn't worried in the least!\n",
      "7785 \t That's my Sayuri! A perfect self-introduction! I'm so proud, as both senpai and girlfriend!\n",
      "7786 \t Since she'd sort of caused an incident, Sayuri was removed from being in charge of room 306 under the Chief's orders. But since I hadn't been removed from being in charge of said room, I take her into 306 with me as my preceptee.\n",
      "7787 \t It's the night shift now, but because of the incident with Kohaku, we can't leave yet. This time, Clarice is called over to the break room, where Sayuri and the Chief are.\n",
      "7788 \t Two months later... Clarice's Graves' disease started to show signs of getting better after her pollen allergies cleared up, and since she's well enough to go home, she's leaving the hospital today. Oh, and since Kohaku had gotten sick from the cold wave at the end of spring and couldn't control her blood sugar, her hospital stay was more of a preventative measure. She left after about two weeks. She would come to visit Clarice whenever she was off school, though, and every time Yamanouchi saw them together in the hospital room, she'd sneer to herself....Don't become a no good grown up like Yamanouchi, all right, you two? ...But as much as I want to say that to them, I feel like going into detail would sully their young ears, so I have to keep quiet. If, if only...!\n",
      "7789 \t Yamanouchi has become my preceptor. With a crafty old fox like Yamanouchi teaching me the ropes I can become every bit the pro she is!! Yeah, I've got to seize this bull by the horns!! ...But I can only get so far by psyching myself up.\n",
      "7790 \t And so, Mrs. Amino ultimately passed away.\n",
      "7791 \t _RE\n",
      "7792 \t _RE\n",
      "7793 \t It's been three days since Yamanouchi opened up to me about her past. The number of times I have talked to Yamanouchi personally since then has hit rock bottom. Yamanouchi is in the ward when I arrive today, getting ready to end her night shift.\n",
      "7794 \t Reports are about to start as usual. The Chief looks around at the assembled staff. Yamanouchi brings things to a standstill by requesting a moment.\n",
      "7795 \t In the end we went to Yamanouchi's place to lounge around, her nickname still undecided.\n",
      "7796 \t The same old work day. The same old handing off of reports to the night nurses. I think I delivered today's reports relatively smoothly....Yeah, I suppose I'm firmly on the path to developing as a nurse, one step at a time...\n",
      "7797 \t How many days have passed since? When all was said and done Yamanouchi decided to stay at Yurigahama Hospital. But I'm terrified...that one day she'll have a change of heart, and just vanish...\n",
      "7798 \t I shakily drop to my knees. And bring my face closer to her feet... But then......In the split second before contact...something tugs at my resolve.\n",
      "7799 \t I return to my room, and stretch theatrically. I step out of my underwear before getting into the bath when it suddenly occurs to me that I've not been assisting on Yamanouchi's draft's lately. She's making a pro debut with a pro draft. An amateur like me probably couldn't help her... The thought's saddening. I suppose I should be happy for Yamanouchi making it pro...right?\n",
      "7800 \t I open my eyes nice and slowly.            There's nothing. Only darkness.     Then, a little girl I've never seen     appears in front of me.\n",
      "7801 \t Oh...            That dream again...\n",
      "7802 \t Another one of those dreams... That strange girl appears in the midst of nothingness, asking me tough questions. What will it be this time?\n",
      "7803 \t This dream again...         One little girl,         standing in the middle of nothingness. She looks straight at me.\n",
      "7804 \t She really reamed me out after that.\n",
      "7805 \t Ami's concert ends without a single problem. She bows to the patients that came to see her, then she walks off with a kick in her step.\n",
      "7806 \t Work ends, and I go home and take a bath. It should be coming tonight. There it is!\n",
      "7807 \t When we fell down the stairs, Ami broke her right wrist. They didn't have enough people in surgery at Yurigahama and there were no orthopedic surgeons on hand, so she was moved to Mizusawa Emergency Medical Center to get surgery on her right hand. Time passes, and it's spring again. Ami transferred from Sakuradachi High School to a local school near her home, and is a senior there now. Her dream is to become a professional forteleu player. There was no telling if she can become a pro, but her broken right wrist will keep it from coming true. She can't play like she used to, so being a normal girl again, she decided to transfer to a normal high school. She tells me she sometimes sees her friends from Sakuradachi in the streets, but she doesn't have anything to talk to them about so it only makes her sad. Seeing as she transferred as a senior and spent most of her student life playing the forteleu, she doesn't have much in common with her classmates and she feels lonelier than ever....I'm the only one that can cure her loneliness.\n",
      "7808 \t Time to get back! I should go see Ami before I go though.\n",
      "7809 \t ...Wait, where am I? In the vast emptiness, across the plain of mysterious darkness, stands a young girl.\n",
      "7810 \t Wait...           This emptiness again...           Am I having the same dream as before? The girl that appears before me wears a serious expression.\n",
      "7811 \t This dream again...        The girl stands there as she always does,        with a sad smile on her face.\n",
      "7812 \t I slowly open my eyes. A girl stands in the nothingness. Oh, this dream again.\n",
      "7813 \t Oh... It's this dream again. The girl is smiling so calmly today, though.\n",
      "7814 \t The next thing I notice, I'm in a completely empty world.        Is this that dream I always have? That girl is standing before me, with Mayuki by her side.\n",
      "7815 \t Mayuki gets out of the hospital soon after that, and while living with what looks like her older sister, she goes to middle school. Of course she doesn't need to go back to school, but apparently she wants to start her life over. A lot of people worked to set it up, and she was able to enter middle school, but......Middle school is still part of mandatory education. I wonder what her personal records are like. However, I decide it better not to ask questions and just accept the fact that she's going to middle school. It's important to let the little things slide! Sometimes, she comes to my dorm after work. Just like this.\n",
      "7816 \t The next thing I notice, I'm in a world of nothingness.      Is this that dream I always have? That girl and Mayuki stand side by side. She looks at me with a big smile. Then, she disappears into Mayuki's body. It's the girl that I always saw in my dream. I was just starting to feel close to her, so I can't hide my shock when she disappears. I want to call her name so badly, but I can't remember it. Even after all those times she called me by my name!!\n",
      "7817 \t I head into work as usual, and walk into Mayuki's room as part of my normal routine.\n",
      "7818 \t Someone wraps their arms around my back as I try to decide what to do next.\n",

All the sounds that cars and city life normally drowned out were now given a chance to be heard. I realized that it was the sounds of nature that stood at the heart of the world, and it drove home once more that the world of men stood still. I thought of Riko, wondering what she was doing alone and what she was thinking about. We had to tell her the mansion was gone. She probably knew already. Emissaries could most likely feel its disappearance. It had been a part of us, after all. Besides, it did not inconvenience us. As I drove home, the two Eidea were always in front, and I returned their stolid gaze. I realized I had never faced them quite as directly as then.
